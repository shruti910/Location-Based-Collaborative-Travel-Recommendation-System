SPACE CAMP!",E:\touristplaces_pics\1.jpg,1,US Space and Rocket Center,Alabama,AL
1,,"When you’ve got the highest point in North America, it’s hard to argue that cruise ship fjords are a better attraction. Denali -- or Mt. McKinley as you may know it -- is the centerpiece of this 6-million-acre national park, only a small percentage of which is accessible by car.",E:\touristplaces_pics\2.jpg,2,Denali National Park and Preserve,Alaska,AK
2,,"While some have argued that a visit to the Grand Canyon basically amounts to driving two hours through the desert, enjoying the canyon's beauty for five minutes, spending another five minutes there because you feel bad, then trying to figure out what to do with the rest of your day, the fact remains -- it's still one of the most awe-inspiring natural wonders in the world.",E:\touristplaces_pics\3.jpg,3,Grand Canyon,Arizona,AZ
3,,"Sure, the somewhat-sulphuric smell of bubbling pools of natural hot water can be occasionally noxious. So can a trip to one of Arkansas’ many Walmarts, but at least here you leave relaxed. America’s oldest national preserve and smallest national park was once home to a mighty row of bathhouses where rich and poor alike came to bathe and be healed by the springs' naturally hot waters. ",E:\touristplaces_pics\4.jpg,4,Hot Springs National Park,Arkansas,AR

5,"Denver, CO","If you’ve seen one legal marijuana dispensary, you’ve seen ‘em all. And since not everyone can ski, the best attraction in Colorado is hands down this live music venue outside Denver. ",E:\touristplaces_pics\6.jpg,6,Red Rocks Amphitheater,Colorado,CO
6,"New Haven, CT","Yes, we are telling you the coolest thing to do in Connecticut is eat lunch. ESPN headquarters is more overrated than the SEC, and Louis' Lunch is the birthplace of the hamburger (although why it’s not called a Newhavener, you’ll have to ask them). If you don't believe us, just ask the Library of Congress.",E:\touristplaces_pics\7.jpg,7,Louis' Lunch,Connecticut,CT
7,"Rehoboth Beach, DE","You know people love your beer when consumer demand forces you to expand your facilities TWICE in less than 20 years. Which is what the makers of your favorite 90 Minute IPA and Indian Brown Ale have done, with this location on The Avenue in one of America's best small beach towns. ",E:\touristplaces_pics\8.jpg,8,Dogfish Head Brewery,Delaware,DE
8,"Orlando,FL","Because federal law mandates that all people with children who live east of the Mississippi must visit this Central Florida fun factory at least once. Sure, Florida has thousands of miles of beaches and the insanity of Miami, but spending three hours in line with sweltering humidity, screaming children, and a melting mouse-ear ice cream bar for a three-minute ride really puts the “sunshine” in your “Sunshine State” experience.",E:\touristplaces_pics\9.jpg,9,Disney world,Florida,FL
9,"Atlanta,GA","“Aquarium” is kind of a deceiving term here, as this Atlanta aqua land is really more like SeaWorld without the animal abuse. Here you can scuba dive with whale sharks and manta rays, play with otters and penguins, work alongside Beluga trainers",E:\touristplaces_pics\10.jpg,10,Georgia Aquarium,Georgia,GA

11,,"Sure, after finally landing on the actual moon, NASA said the name of this park was totally misleading, but changing all the signs to say “Craters That Look Nothing Like the Moon but are Still Totally Badass National Park” was going too far. So the name remains, as does this 400-square-mile preserve where you can walk on giant basaltic lava fields, hike through caves, and peer into the world’s deepest rift crack.",E:\touristplaces_pics\1.jpg,12,Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve,Idaho,ID
12,"Chicago, IL","To keep the stands packed after years upon years upon years upon years of losing baseball takes something special. And the ivy-covered walls and throwback neighborhood-ballpark aesthetics of Wrigley are exactly that, where even long-suffering Cubs fans don’t seem to be suffering all that much when they’re knocking back Goose Islands in the bleachers and enjoying the best example today of baseball’s bygone glory days.",E:\touristplaces_pics\1.jpg,13,Wrigley Field,Illinois,IL
13,"Indianapolis, IN","Kinda like how we only care about soccer once every four years with the World Cup, Americans more or less only notice IndyCar racing on Memorial Day weekend, when the best drivers in the world descend on Indianapolis for the Indy 500.",E:\touristplaces_pics\1.jpg,14,Indianapolis Motor Speedway,Indiana,IN
14,"Dyersville, IA","Whereas most Hollywood movies tend to cop out and use LA as the backdrop for pretty much everything (who knew there were cliffs in Miami Beach!?), FODproducers went authentic and shot this '80s baseball classic on the Lansing family farm in Dyersville. ",E:\touristplaces_pics\1.jpg,15,The Field of Dreams Filming Locale,Iowa,IA
15,,"As you’ve probably used the expression “Get the heck outta Dodge” thousands of times and likely had no idea where it came from, well, here's your answer. In Dodge City, you can step back into an era where middle-of-the-street gunfights were the norm, ",E:\touristplaces_pics\1.jpg,16,"Boot Hill/Dodge City, KS",Kansas,KS
16,,"The thing to remember about doing the Bourbon Trail: DO NOT DO IT ALL IN ONE DAY. That’s 10 distilleries, and even if you designate a driver, you can’t designate a hangover-er, so it’s best to explore Western Kentucky (and the distilleries of Jim Beam, Woodford Reserve, Maker's Mark, Wild Turkey, and more) in shifts, staying at the historic inns in between. ",E:\touristplaces_pics\1.jpg,17,Kentucky Bourbon Trail,Kentucky,KY
17,"New Orleans, LA","Not that Louisiana doesn’t have plenty of other great things to offer, like, uh, Shreveport, but if you say you’re going to this state, people assume you’re going to drink Hand Grenades, listen to jazz, eat the best food in the country, and then make some bad decisions. ",E:\touristplaces_pics\1.jpg,18,Bourbon Street/French Quarter,Louisiana,LA
18,,"The oldest national park east of the Mississippi sits just off the rocky shores of Down East Maine and boasts 47,000 acres of pristine New England beauty.

19,,"While Baltimore has a pretty cool boardwalk and a nifty retro baseball stadium, you know what it doesn’t have? The US Naval Academy. Or the oldest bar in the state. Or, well, you get it. And since Edgar Allen Poe’s house is in a neighborhood that makes the Tell Tale Heart look like Sweet Valley High, the most unique and non-deadly place you can go in Maryland is historic Annapolis.",E:\touristplaces_pics\1.jpg,20,Annapolis/U.S. Naval Academy,Maryland,MD
20,"Boston,MA","Escape the throngs of loudmouthed Boston sports fans trying to convince you that Brady is innocent by immersing yourself in US history instead, as you walk the 2.5-mile Freedom Trail through the city. While top sites include the Boston Tea Party Museum, Paul Revere’s House, Bunker Hill, and Faneuil Hall, the highlight is America's oldest warship",E:\touristplaces_pics\1.jpg,21,USS Constitution,Massachusetts,MA
21,,"Michigan might be the most underrated state in America when it comes to natural beauty, and nowhere is that more obvious than during a summer trip to this spot smack between the Upper and Lower Peninsulas.

23,"Vicksburg, MS","While Gettysburg gets all the love from Yankees, perhaps the greatest War-Between-the-States battle site sits in Western Mississippi, where this 47-day siege on Vicksburg and the associated campaign claimed more than 20,000 total casualties and resulted in the Union taking control of the Mississippi River.",E:\touristplaces_pics\1.jpg,24,Vicksburg National Military Park,Mississippi,MS
24,,"Since St. Louis was considered the Gateway to the West, this arch was constructed in the 1960s to give the St. Louis skyline an iconic monument.

25,,"Think of Glacier as the anti-Bieber: while both the US and Canada keep trying to stick the other one with the Biebs, they both want to lay claim to this national park whose 16,000 square miles of mountains, rivers, and general untamed spectacular wilderness lie both in the States and north of the border.",E:\touristplaces_pics\1.jpg,26,Glacier National Park,Montana,MT
26,,"As the bluffs on the southern edge of the North Platte River Valley eroded like Nebraska’s football tradition, this 325ft spire made of rock between 23-34 million years old began to tower above the plains.

27,"Las Vegas, NV","Without the Strip, what happens in Vegas would stay in Vegas because nobody would really want to hear about it. This 4.2-mile stretch of South Las Vegas Blvd is home to 15 of the 25 largest hotels in the world, two of the best pool parties, every gourmet restaurant you can name, and at least one or two fairly attractive women. And despite not technically being IN the city of Las Vegas, “the Strip” has become America’s symbol of lost inhibitions, limitless parties, and questionable decisions.",E:\touristplaces_pics\1.jpg,28,Las Vegas Strip,Nevada,NV
28,,"The highest point in New England is a lot more than just a tall mountain. It’s a tall mountain with weather so volatile it makes your worst ex look like a bastion of Zen. Not only did its summit hold the Earth's record for fastest wind gust ever recorded (231mph!) for 76 years, but annual temps can fluctuate between a downright pleasant 72 degrees and, well, a staggering -102 degrees with the wind chill.",E:\touristplaces_pics\1.jpg,29,Mount Washington,New Hampshire,NH

30,,"Hard to believe it, but inland New Mexico was a sea 250 million years ago, full of marine life that created living coral reefs. Which made for spectacular scuba diving then and, after 250 million years of limestone erosion, some pretty badass caves now. ",E:\touristplaces_pics\1.jpg,31,Carlsbad Caverns,New Mexico,NM
31,"New York, NY","No big surprises here, but in a city that’s one, giant tourist attraction, nothing keeps ‘em coming in droves like the big green lady in the middle of New York Harbor. In addition to being our nation’s symbol of freedom and opportunity, it is also the single greatest thing the French ever did that didn’t involve fries or toast. ",E:\touristplaces_pics\1.jpg,32,Statue of Liberty,New York,NY
32,"Asheville, NC","A trip to the mountains outside of Asheville and this historic Vanderbilt family estate will have you forgetting you’re in the same state as the NASCAR Hall of Fame.

33,,"At one time, Teddy owned two ranches in the Badlands of North Dakota and would go there to live the “strenuous life” among wild horses, bighorn sheep, golden eagles, and wild turkeys.

34,"Sandusky, OH","Though we do love to take jabs at Ohio, it’s hard to hate on Cedar Point, the second-oldest amusement park in America. Very much living up to its nickname, “The Roller Coaster Capital of the World,” CP boasts 16 coasters -- including four that stand over 200ft tall -- and a world-record 72 rides total. It's been drawing visitors to Ohio since 1870, when Anaheim was still orange groves and Orlando was nothing but swampland.",E:\touristplaces_pics\1.jpg,35,Cedar Point,Ohio,OH

36,,"Though the Beaver State is 48% forest, its only national park is a 286-square-mile swath of land whose main attraction is the deepest lake in the United States. The six-mile-wide body of water is 1,148ft deep and was formed by the collapse of Mount Mazama. In fact, a remaining cone of its cinder makes up Wizard Island in the middle.",E:\touristplaces_pics\1.jpg,37,Crater Lake,Oregon,OR
37,"Gettysburg, PA","And no, do not go around town asking people where the Gettysburg address is. In case you did a complete brain dump after 10th grade history, the Address was a speech Lincoln gave on this historic Civil War battlefield where the war turned in July 1863.

39,,"Conde Nast readers don’t rank your city No. 1 in America four times because they love low-lying marshlands.

40,,"Even though the Lakota Sioux tribe called this mountain “Six Grandfathers,” it only rocks the faces of four dudes -- Abe Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson. But those four, 60ft carvings in the side of this granite mountain in South Dakota’s Black Hills don’t need any company as they’re already visited by over two million people a year.

41,"Memphis, TN","If America has had only one king, then Graceland marks both the beginning and the end of our country’s historic castles tour.

42,,"Texas is so big, its tourist attractions are bigger than some states. Seriously, the 800,000-plus acres that make up this park are bigger than Rhode Island.

44,"Waterbury, VT","Unlike laws, sausages, and adult films, those who enjoy ice cream should most DEFINITELY watch it being made.

46,"Seattle, WA","Even though the original Starbucks is two blocks away, and you’re TOTALLY going to stop in there first and see if it looks like... a Starbucks, this open-air market is like a farmers market on steroids -- and a must-see in Seattle.
