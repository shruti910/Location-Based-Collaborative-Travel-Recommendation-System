Their specialty are mousse drinks - which we had no idea what exactly it was. So when we asked the staff, they said it was some sort of cheese. \n\nFor a Sunday afternoon, they were also out of grass jelly and pudding, which are ingredients in quite a few of their drinks (so not sure how that works).\n\nThe service is really bad, they don't understand English so when you asked them about the menu items, they can't really explain what they are.\n\nWe had ordered the following:\n- slush mango (came with tapioca and mousse)\n- peach ice tea\n- roasted oolong milk tea\n- supernova kumquat lemonade\n\nAnd when we asked what the difference between a supernova kumquat lemonade under the galaxy drinks section (which are supposed to be layered drinks), and the kumquat lemonade, they said it had a layer of blue mousse - so we were like ok we will try it then. But what came was just a bigger cup size of the kumquat lemonade. When we asked them again, they said it was just a size difference, that's what makes it supernova - which is pretty dumb to me as on the menu both items had the same two size choices of regular or large. \n\nThe mango slush and the roasted oolong milk tea wasn't bad. But the other two was not that great. The tea had a big floral taste that overpowered everything. There was no peach taste in the peach ice tea. The kumquat one had no kumquat taste and was just bitter from the lime and it tasted like it had no sugar in it at all.\n\nI guess if you need a non-busy place to use WIFI and work, then this is the place, no one wants to come here.\n\nAlso - their gimmick also seems to be the lightbulb drinks, which were intriguing to us, but you are not allowed to take the lightbulb home...\n\nWe will definitely not be returning...","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

SO GOOD that it melts in your mouth - so soft and tender. If it wasn't because we had ordered so much food and this was the last main course that showed up, we would have devoured it.\n\nFor dessert, we had ordered the Foie and Nutella, as we thought this was very interesting.

I have had plenty of bad manicures before, so I know what a bad job looks like. Just don't go expecting someone to fuss over you, or give you plenty of conversation. English is not the first language and I have never felt the need to force conversation. \nIn this past year I have noticed a huge increase in the number of people that go to this spa, so they seem to be doing quite well. I have never had to wait more than ten minutes for service though and I'm happier they are busy because it means they are doing well and will stay in business.

I have had so many bad experiences at this place, I just need to give up on it. \n\nA few years ago, Sheppard Centre was an alright place. When I lived at Yonge and Sheppard, there was a grocery store across the street and all the basics you would need st Sheppard Centre and it was good. \n\nSheppard Centre is at a major subway stop, in a hugely busy area, but somehow stores keep failing here. \n\nThat being the case, there are a few stores that are nice and handy. I would consider this mall for errands, now that I live away...except that the major reason for coming is gone now.\n\nSheppard Centre used to have 1 hour of free parking, which is a huge draw. You could go and park, run in and pick up your mail, or something from Shoppers Drug Mart and be on your way. They got rid of that. Not only that, but it's $3.50 for half an hour or under!\n\nI think this is pretty pathetic for a crappy mall. \n\n\"OH, but they have to pay for their excellent staff!\" you say?\n\nYeah, let me tell you about the staff that work there. First of all, you should also know that the ticket machine to pay for your parking tickets likes to break down ALL THE TIME, so you have to go to the parking garage and drive up to the ticket booth, park in the non-parking spots, block traffic and go in and pay the guys sitting around in the office...an office with TV screens of the parking garage, where our car has been broken into before...but it's not their fault. There are SIGNS that say they are not liable. Soooo...what are the TV screens for? To WATCH peoples' cars get broken into and laugh?\n\nRight, so back to the story! \n\nBefore I knew what to do when the machines broke down, I went to the in-mall security\/info booth to ask. The guy was behind the booth, on the phone, having a personal conversation. He saw me, but turned away and continued for ten minutes. Finally he got off the phone and made like he was coming over...only to turn away at the last second and start going through some papers. Finally I called out and said, \"Excuse me?\" He told me he was busy and made a point of moving towards me as slowly as possible.\n\nThis isn't the only time a staff member has been rude to me before. Dogs are allowed in the subway, so I was walking through once, to the subway entrance, HOLDING my dog, in my arms and a security guard chased me down to tell me dogs are not allowed.

We booked a trip through gate1travel.com and when you are booking they give you the options for hotels. The default booking is for Circus Circus, NOT Circus, Circus Manor Motor Lodge. It says three stars and even says this on gate1's travel site: \"The rooms are fitted with contemporary decor and furnishings. All rooms are equipped with amenities that will be sure to make your stay pleasant, such as internet access (surcharge), a hair dryer, and a television with cable channels.\"\nWe looked up Circus Circus, saw it was nothing special, but alright and went for it...and found out that in fact, we were in the Manor Motor Lodge.\nNow, I KNOW that this is gate1's fault and I'll be taking it up with them as well. Also, I want to point out that on my second night, I complained and they put us in a suite for the night, so this is nothing against the overall hotel, but there are still a few things people need to know staying here.\nRooms: They are DUMPS in the manor motor lodge. I asked, when we were checking in, if those rooms had been redone at all and was told that \"all the rooms have been updated in SOME way\"...well I don't know what way this room had been updated. The carpets were worn and stained. The bedding was the polyester crap from the 80s. The wallpaper was stained and peeling off the walls. The bathroom floor had cracks in the tile and a permanent grunge that could never been cleaned. It looked like a motel room you see in horror movies!\nThe hallways were constantly loud and smelled of marijuana, with cheap, apple air freshener over top, which was interesting because of the number of small children running around with distinctly trashy families. I even made a joke with a cab driver in Las Vegas, that we were NOT ugly enough to be staying in this hotel. He agreed and said it was the butt of the joke of cabbies on the strip. Good to know.\n\nHotel: The hotel amenities are geared towards children, but are basically a money grab. There is a small, indoor amusement park that costs something like $8\/30 second ride. There are shops and restaurants, but non are high end. We ate at three places while there and overall they were crappy. I'll give those individual ratings though.\n\nService: This was very good actually. I had a very pleasant bell hop help us out and all the wait staff and cleaning staff were very nice and the woman whom I complained to was very receptive and polite, so that earns them an extra star.\n\nThe thing with the hotel is that even these rooms we were stuck in, fall under 3 stars, even though they, by themselves, would barely qualify as 1 star rooms, because the whole hotel falls under one heading.\n\nSO, lesson to be learned, these rooms are NOT nice rooms. The hotel is considerably crappier than other hotels. It's also quite far from the main strip. BUT it is cheap. If you are (for whatever God-awful reason) bringing children to Vegas, I guess this would fit the bill. Otherwise, if you're just looking for a bed and a cheap one, this also fits the bill. The beds, I will say, had clean sheets and were comfortable. But don't be fooled into thinking you're getting this amazing deal on a three star hotel. You're not. You're getting an average deal, on 1 star accommodations.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":1}

It's fine...it's not great!\n\nWe went here on a Saturday night. It's literally a block away from where we live and we have somehow never been. We finally decided to go for it!\n\nThe atmosphere is fine. It's nice and clean and much larger than you would realize from the outside. The decor it a bit cheesy with faux Roman sculptures. \n\nService was very good. The waiter was quick with our drinks and food and was helpful with suggestions. \n\nNow to the food. My husband ordered the veal parm and I ordered a pasta with chicken. We ordered brushetta as a starter. I noticed from the menu that, while a lot of selection, many of the pasta dishes were a bit uninspired. A lot of very basic dishes. Pasta with mushrooms and red sauce, or pasta with shrimp and pesto, etc. I really enjoy creative combinations and flavours when I go to an Italian restaurant, because quite honestly, I can make the basic stuff at home...for a hell of a lot cheaper.\n\nThat said, the pasta dishes were solid, if nothing special. My pasta was well cooked, but the chicken tasted like something you would find in a McDonald's salad and the mushrooms were good, but that was the basis of the dish. My husband's was basic, but veal parms usually are. He did note that there was a LOT of sauce on his. There was, but I like that personally, if there is bread to dip into it...but no bread was served to our table, other than the bread from our brushetta. \n\nThe brushetta wasn't great. The tomato mixture on top was good, but the bread wasn't properly toasted, so it got soggy and couldn't hold its shape. It kept falling apart when you picked it up. \n\nThe desserts really brought this place back for me. I had their homemade creme brule and it was really excellent. On the menu it tells you which are made in-house and I would highly recommend getting one of those. \n\nOverall, it was quite expensive for pretty basic Italian food, so it didn't stun me. I'm not opposed to going back, but it's not my first choice. My major reason for going back will be for convenience, because it is so close to us.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

It was much more akin to ice cream and the flavour selection wasn't huge. \n\nThat said, they have some interesting flavours. I personally tried Twix and birthday cake and they were both very good. The more traditional flavour I tried (creme caramel) was a little boring and lacked flavour. \n\nMy husband had the strawberry, Skor and chocolate. All fine, none blew me away.\n\nOkay, so the gelato is good, if not the \"best\"! But perhaps that's being picky. If I'm in the area and want some dessert, this place is great and I can imagine in the summer it's fantastic.\n\nSo why the three stars?? First of all you can only get gelato in two sizes - regular and large. There is no small option and both of those options are quite large. If you only want a taste of gelato, there is no option for you! \n\nSecondly, although this place is named for it's gelato, it also specializes in cupcakes. We got a cupcake to bring home. When asked if we would like it packaged to bring home we said yes...and they threw it in a bag. The girl apologized and said they had nothing appropriate to package it in. Why did you offer then?? But furthermore, YES YOU DO! You literally have perfectly shaped round cups to put gelato in everywhere! Guess what shape cupcakes are??\n\nOh well, no biggie.\n\nSo, since this place is about the gelato and the cupcakes, you may be interested in the cupcakes...well the taste was overall good, but it was a very oily cupcake. The icing especially. The cake was moist, which is good...except it was SO moist the cake was just falling apart everywhere! \n\nSo what's the final synopsis. This place isn't bad. It has some delicious options. But nothing is perfect and in fact there are a number of flaws, which prevent me from giving it a better score. We'll see how I feel if it's a boiling hot summer day and I go in there for gelato though...I may be singing a different tune!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The manager was brought out and she was immediately snarky and rude towards me. She said she wouldn't accept a charm that was \"all worn and beat up\". I encouraged her to look at the charm. She could clearly see it was in pristine condition. She glanced at my bracelet as a whole, but did not look at the charm, instead insisting that she could tell.\n\nSeriously lady, you don't stand by your product at all?

The pork was pure fat and while it wasn't gristly, it was SO greasy, the grease positively dripped all over your hands. It was hugely unappetizing. I couldn't taste the cucumbers and didn't see any evidence of scallions. It was basically just pure fat, wrapped in a bland \"bun\". So I guess if you enjoy really fatty, greasy appetizers, this is the right deal. (Really, I can't stress enough how fatty the pork was...it was purely, white, greasy fat! Either change the name of the dish to pork fat buns, or please add some actual pork!)\n\nThe noodles however, were quite good and I liked the flavour combinations. I had the dan dan noodles, which is spicy pork, dried scallops and peanuts. I enjoyed that you could really taste the peanuts. I was a little disappointed that the pork was ground pork, instead of shredded pork. It made the dish seem cheaper and less inspired. \n\nI liked the atmosphere, but the seating is at long tables and so you share the space with whoever they place next to you. The seats are long benches, so if you're in the middle of the bench, you have to lift your leg over...I saw guys struggling to do this...now imagine being a girl, wearing a skirt and having to do this. No graceful way to go about that!\n\nTo be honest, this place just didn't blow me away enough to make a conscious effort to return.

One of the major problems was finding it though. Almost every one in our party either didn't see it initially (it's sort of nondescript looking), or weren't sure which door\/staircase was the proper one to get inside. \nOnce inside though, it's an eclectic blend of vintage meets white-washed industrial. If you didn't know that was a style, neither did I, but it totally works. There was a great blend of music in the background...it was a mix, probably an employee just made it, but it was great mood music. I want that mix CD! \nMy brother had called several weeks ago to make a reservation and somehow they didn't have it. Apparently it's an answering service for reservations and they say they call you back if they can't accommodate you. He never received a call back, so the assumption was that the reservation was alright. Unfortunately, as I said, there was no reservation. The staff apologized profusely though and luckily there was space and they set up a table for us right away. \nWe ordered from the drink menu and I will say that they drinks are very expensive. The wine is what you would expect and the mixed drink (at least the one I had, the Smith Lemonade) was fantastic, but it was also $12, which is steep even for Toronto bar standards. \nAs I said, we ordered from the Summerlicious menu. I have heard many comments online that people are feeling disillusioned with Summerlicious because so many restaurants give you the cheapest options and it's not worth the cost. This was NOT the case with Smith at all. There were several great options to choose from and the food was excellent. I had the curried carrot soup, which was spicy but great. Every one else in my party also enjoyed their various appetizers. My main course was a Georgian Bay whitefish, which was done perfectly, just crispy enough on the outside and flaky on the inside. The pork chops were also raved about. There was also a risotto, which two of the three people who ordered it really enjoyed. You can't take that last guy (brother again) too seriously, since he's a very picky eater. \nThe desserts were all good, however the fudge ice cream, is really just chocolate ice cream, nothing special. The lemon curd tasted like lemon pie filling and was delicious and the bread pudding was heavenly! Seriously, it was SO good. \nI think everyone left feeling really satisfied. \nIt did take a long time to get the food. This wasn't a problem for us, since we were there to converse and I understand that great food may take some time, but if you are really hungry, or looking for a quicker meal, this isn't the right choice.\nBasically it lost of star because of the lost reservation and lack of visibility from the street. Also, we weren't thrilled with the washrooms. Besides the fact that they are co-ed, which is a little weird, there is one, large sink and a foot peddle to operate it. Since only one person can step on it at a time, you have to wait for that person to finish, before you can wash your hands, which starts to cause a bit of a back-up if more than two people are in the washroom. Also, the hand dryers were weak\/not working. \nThat said, I wouldn't let a slightly annoying bathroom stop me from coming here! This is a nice, little place!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

I spoke to the hostess and a manager came out and graciously moved us, which was very nice of them, because apparently many people call and reserve specific seats! \n\nI have walked by this restaurant a million times and never known it was there. It is directly on Bloor, but in a small \"mall\" which houses The Japanese Foundation and some other businesses. The restaurant is on the second floor and there are no readily visible signs on the street, so you would never think to just walk into this place...maybe that's the point! \n\nThe decor of the restaurant is really lovely. They have a huge, stain glass ceiling and dark wooden furniture and Art Nouveau decor. The bathrooms are large, individually sectioned off stall, with white and black tiles everywhere and large, vintage, French ads on the walls. \n\nTwo of our party ordered from the Winterlicious menu, one ordered from the regular menu and I ordered from their regular Prix Fixe menu, which they have available all the time and is $7 more than the Winterlicious. \n\nThey were also offering some Winterlicious cocktails...I had three (the same one) and they were excellent. \n\nOur appetizers included two salads, which looked great and (according to the orderes) were. My husband ordered the onion soup from the Winterlicious menu and it was great and I ordered the mushroom soup from the prix fixe and it was excellent!\n\nThe main courses included steak from the regular menu, which were ordered with steak frites. The steak was a nice cut of meat, prepared exactly as asked and the steak frites were served with a garlic aioli (which we all tried) and was really good!\n\nThe lasagna and pork belly were ordered from the Winterlicious menu. Lasagna came in a rounded dish, where it had been baked and was on the smaller side, but satisfying within a three course meal. My husband had the pork belly from the Winterlicious menu and I tried that. The sauce on it and the tenderness of the pork were really nice. \n\nI had the pistachio chicken, which was a huge dish! The chicken breast was served on top of another cut of chicken, but in dark meat. Both had pistachios on top and delicious sauces drizzled along the bottom of the plate and a few apple slices as garnish. I couldn't finish two pieces of chicken and I stuck mostly with the white meat, but it was a nice option to have to two and I tried the dark and it was really excellent as well! \n\nThe reason I chose the prix fixe menu over the Winterlicious, was because of the dessert. The Winterlicious had the pistachio chicken as a main and the onion soup was an option for the appetizer, but the desserts set the prix fixe apart. On the Winterlicious menu the option was a rhubarb crumble, or chocolate mousse. Neither of which I really cared for, although I tried it from my husband and it was good. On the prix fixe menu you have a choice of creme brule (which I have heard good things about) and a sticky toffee cake. I asked the waitress what she recommended and she said the sticky toffee, because it was such a lovely, winter dessert. I had been set on the creme brule, but you know what....brules are a dime a dozen. How many places have sticky, toffee cake? \n\nI was NOT disappointed. The cake was amazing! It was a small, singular bundt cake, topped with a toffee crisp and a small scoop of caramel ice cream and surrounded on the plate with warm, caramel. It was decadent and delicious. \n\nFinally I'll mention that our server was lovely and attentive and not a single person in our party were disappointed in any way. We all left very happy and satisfied. \n\nThis place is a little on the pricier end (would have been less so except for the three drinks myself and my friend had and the beers that the guys had), but it's great for a nice night out, or a romantic date. \n\nI will definitely come back some time in the future.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Some of the friends has heard that this place KNOWS their wine and ordered a bottle of chianti, which was great (and I'm not a huge wine drinker). \nThe ladies I was with ordered two caesar salads to share amongst the four of them and the waitress brought them out the salads already split on individual plates, garnished with a garlic bread crouton. I don't think the salads were anything special, but I find that caesar salads in general aren't, so peoples' complaints about them below seem largely unfounded. \nI ordered the baked goat cheese appetizer...OMG it was SO good. Goat cheese and grilled veggies on top of a portobello mushroom cap, with some sort of sauce and with salad and shredded carrots and balsamic reduction....to DIE for. \nFor my main I ordered the Penne Gorgonzola, which was also fabulous! The members of my partied ordered the veal parmesan (but grilled veggies instead of the pasta), the salmon with a lobster brandy cream sauce, a NY striploin and fettucine and everyone loved their food. One woman I was with IS a chef, so I feel like that was saying something. \nNow, since I didn't taste their dishes, I can only expand on my own. The sauce was to DIE for. Creamy, complex and delicious. The pairing of veggies with prosciutto and cheese was excellent. I would order that dish again in a heartbeat! \nSince we were having a good time and the food had met our expectations, we went for it and ordered dessert (even though we were all stuffed). We all ordered the white chocolate creme br√ªl√©e, except one friend who ordered the tiramisu and were once again not disappointed. Our creme br√ªl√©es were crackly on the outside and creamy on the inside. Perfect! The tiramisu was apparently great, served very untraditionally in a large plate, with an indentation like a bowl in the middle. \nI was also pleased to find out that they serve caffeine-free cappuccinos, so we all ordered those as well and it was served with a little almond biscotti and was great!\n\nAltogether my meal came to $50 (tip included), which I think is more than I would spend on a normal dinner out, but not crazy. Also note though that I did not pay for the wine and did not order any other drinks. That would obviously have increased the price. \n\nThe restaurant atmosphere is nothing special, but I'm disenchanted with the trendy spaces and pretentiously presented food that isn't half as good, so this wasn't a concern for me. The restaurant was clean and comfy, but the furniture was a little on the older side (like the dining chairs you would see in your fussy grandmother's home) and fake paintings on the walls.   \n\nThe service was excellent. Our waitress saw to our every need, answered all our questions and came over to chat and make sure we were happy and comfortable regularly. \n\nSo, was it perfect? Well as I said, the salad was probably just average and the atmosphere also just average, but those did not pose major problems. I would ultimately give this place 4-1\/2, but since I can't and this leaned more to the good than anything remotely bad, it gets a 5! I would go back in a heartbeat!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I asked the server if it was processed cheese, or \"real\" cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what I was talking about. I tried to clarify by saying, \"Is it like Kraft single slices, or deli cheese?\" He said it was \"good\". This really should have been a sign and I could probably fault the waiter for this, since you SHOULD know what you're serving, but he was so sweet, I couldn't be mad!\n\nMy husband ordered a hot dog of sorts.\n\nI asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad. There was not, but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway (no charge). I asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich.\n\nOf course, my sandwich was made with plasticy, processed cheese, that was melted to the point of Cheeze-Wiz and was inedible. I took one bite of the sandwich and couldn't do another.

I went home and took the polish off.

I went in and sat down the a woman with an Eastern European accent  came to talk with me. I showed her a picture of what I wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples....none of which looked like my picture, but I always assume the hair dressers know what's best. Now, you're all thinking, \"..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour...\" right? \nNope, she told me she couldn't do my hair because I had lice! Of course I freaked out. Another hair dresser came over to see if I was alright and I was mortified. She asked if I had experienced any itching. I said no. This hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it wasn't too bad yet, but original hairdresser said it was really, really bad. I freaked out and left (obviously without having anything done) and went to a Shoppers and bought lice shampoo. I went home and had my husband look at my hair. He looked and looked and could find nothing. I still didn't want to take chances, so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and I went to a walk-in clinic. The doctor looked at my head and ALSO said there was nothing there! \nSince I was paranoid, I still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest I went to examine it. But even with my husband and mother looking at my head, we never found a single thing. We didn't even see dandruff!! I went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful...but dry at the ends...yeah, because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo! Thanks a lot you crazy woman!\nSo ultimately, I never had lice. I don't know if this woman just decided she didn't feel like doing my hair, or if she was delusional, but I sure won't be going back there EVER again.

So I'm always on the lookout for new cupcake places. I was in Scarborough Town Centre and came upon this kiosk. It's not a storefront, but a rather ingenious booth, with colourful signs and a glass showcase full of cupcakes. \n\nThere is a long list of flavours and I suspect (as with many places) they make different cupcakes for different days. \n\nI ordered 6, which was $18...I know, it's steep, that's pretty standard. Cupcake places seem to range from around the $2.25 mark to around $4\/cupcake. So these guys fall somewhere inbetween. But not cheap, so I expect excellence, needless to say.\n\nNow, here's the strange thing. On their website each cupcake is listed as $2.90....was this the case at the store?? I sure hope not. Why would you have to pay MORE for buying more? Maybe it's an ordering online thing? Anyway, my GUESS is that you're paying $3\/cupcake at the store, or $18 for 6. No real incentive to buy 6. But I did, so moving on....\n\nOf course I chose a range of flavours: oreo cookie. chocolate with vanilla icing, salted caramel, lemon and a double chocolate. \n\nOver two days we managed to work our way through them (myself and my husband) and I nibbled the different flavours. Lemon was my favorite, by far, with the salted caramel being a huge disappointment. It was entirely too salty. More salt than caramel. It wasn't very good at all.\n\nBut that said, none of the cupcakes really blew me away. AND in fact, they were VERY stale the next day, despite being stored in an airtight container, in the fridge. Luckily, the cold buttercream frosting was easy to scoop off and once they had been in the oven for a few minutes, they softened up a bit. \n\nThe bottoms of the cupcakes stuck to the wrappers and the flavours were dull tasting and uninspired. \n\nI was also surprised at the lack of creativity in terms of Christmas flavours or designed. Right before Christmas you would expect some special flavours...maybe a candy cane, or gingerbread cupcake. It would be so easy to switch out one flavour and try to get people to consider your product for a Christmas party dessert. \n\nHaving a little kiosk in a mall is a smart idea. Sadly, this business is not one I think I will bother with again!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The other appetizer was similar to an Indian samosa (similar name too, but I can't remember exactly what it was called). They were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell. They were DELICIOUS. BUT, their appetizers were only made for three people, so there were only three of them! Seems silly when you offer a four person deal. \nWe each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter, so we could all share.

They're nothing special, but they're only used as a sort of utensil, because you use it to scoop up the food. The food was delicious! I especially liked the chickpea dish. Every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best! Worked out well. I personally found the beef dish very tough though. \nOnce we were stuff with the food, we ordered two desserts. We especially liked the cheesecake (which is obviously not Ethiopian). \nWe asked if they had any Ethiopian coffees and they said yes. THey showed us the beans, as they were being roasted.

(Not insulting, we just got a laugh). \nNothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay. This was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy.\nBecause the brunch itself didn't blow me away, food shortages and service, I'm not sure if I would bother with brunch again. Oliver and Bonicini in the actual mall has a much better brunch. I might try this again for lunch or dinner though.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Apparently it is MY fault they sent the wrong thing, because I sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call...which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something. Which makes zero sense, because two orders were not sent. And the person I was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails I sent with codes to try out....so I have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different. \n\nThey also told me they blocked me on instagram because I was body shaming their models. I want to be VERY clear on this. I never once body shamed, or made any comments on instagram about their models. I asked why they were promoting clothing they don't even have in stock on instagram...apparently that equates to body shaming to them. \n\nThey also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me (3), they were going to start to charge me for shipping. They seemed to forget that I had also been paying to ship items back to them and that I had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders. It's not that they weren't charging me for shipping...it was that I was taking advantage of their own promos. Apparently I can't use their promos anymore, because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now. At least for me. \n\nThey did not address the code not working. \n\nI responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be. \n\nThen I did some research and sent another email. Instead of returning the dress I would donate it to Dress for Success. I said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth. My request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good. I asked that they take the remaining $9.98 credit I had and put it towards them making a small donation, either monetarily or a piece of clothing, also to the charity. I stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to, but if they wouldn't do it for me, perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need. I said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness. \n\nA few hours later I received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to Dress for Success...for the amount of $10 via the store....so my remainder amount I had paid for and Big Sis Closet's contribution of....two cents. Their generosity is astounding. NOW, I don't know that they haven't made their own donation and just not told me of course...I'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard. But given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service, well...I think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject. No further correspondence was sent from the actual store. \n\nBut at any rate, I am donating the new dress to Dress for Success (along with my $9.98) and I am officially done with this store for good. And I sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here. The clothes are not good quality, but more than that...I have NEVER experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life. Zero regard for their customers, zero regard for their own mistakes, zero regard for taking ownership of...anything! Just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers. These people do not deserve your business and quite frankly...ladies you deserve better. Better clothing (I have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them...loose threads, flimsy, cheap fabric, wrong stitching for the fabric, no lining, incorrect fit for size, etc.) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Finally...La Revolucion answered!\n\nWe walked in and were greeted with....a dishwasher, sitting in the middle of the floor. Sort of strange...maybe some kitchen renos? We walked to meet our friends and their table and were informed that the reservations were not made, or were forgotten and the waitress had had to kick out a single guy from the table and he was eating at the bar. Maybe he was lucky, because the table was SO sticky underneath that my shoes were sticking to the ground. I mean STICKING!\n\nShe took our drink orders and then gave us our drinks and walked away. It took us another 15 minutes before we could place our order. Around the table we ordered two burritos, one plate of tacos and one quesadilla and guacamole bites (which is basically nachos and guac). \n\nThe guac came out fast, and was quite good, but we then waited for almost forty minutes for our food!\n\nBurritos were a bit bland. Needs some sauce in, or on top. Quesadillas were the same...nothing special. The tacos got favorable reviews, but again, nothing to write home about. \n\nThe back area houses a sort of club-like atmosphere, which is described in blogto as: \"...dark textured walls and ambient lighting, it is the opposite of its cocina counterpart. Records adorn the walls and instruments lay strewn about, giving it a relaxed basement rec-room vibe...July will see live music on Thursdays and Fridays with open jam Tuesdays. Flamenco Saturdays are in the works...\"\n\nWhen we were there (on a Saturday) there was a sign out front for a \"dance party\". The lights were down in the back, with a sort of laser light show and early 90s hip hop music was playing. There were about three, older guys there, just hanging out, drinking. It seemed totally out of place. The music didn't match, certainly wasn't flamenco and that's a weird rec room vibe...if that's even something you would want in a restaurant.\n\nI think this place has potential. People in the area like it and it has a nice vibe to it...or would, had we had better service and less stickiness and washers sitting around. I feel like the space is just not being utilized and that's a shame. \n\nI WOULD have giving this place two stars, but the extra star was a result of the sangria, which is their \"secret recipe\" and were amazing. I had two actually.\n\nAnyway, if I was in the area, I might stop in again, as everything was fine, but I don't think I'll be making any special trips to go there in the future.

My friend ordered the salad and the soup and I ordered the calamari sandwich and soup as the side. The sandwich had some great aioli on it and the calamari was nicely done, however I wasn't a huge fan of the bun it was in. It had a sort of sweet taste you might enjoy as a french toast, but not with something savoury and some of the calamari was a little tough. THat said, the sauces covered the taste from the bread and the texture was good and overall it was tasty.\n\nThe soup I found to have too much black pepper mixed in. The waitress asked and I mentioned and she brought back a small container with grated parmesan cheese and suggested I mix some in, because it cuts the pepper taste. \n\nShe was right!

I've never had charcuterie before and I'm not generally a big meat eater, so this was a little out of the box. That said, I like trying to be adventurous and trying new things, so when are visiting friends suggested we give it a go, we went for it. Dinner service is open at 6pm, so we agreed we'd arrive at 6pm. We got there at about 6:15....there was already a HUGE wait for a table, but we managed to wrangle seats at the bar. \n\nThe four of us ordered a bunch of dishes to split between ourselves. We tried the charcuterie (sort of a platter of assorted sliced meats and p√¢t√©), horse tar tar, roasted bone marrow, pork carnitas tacos, tongue on brioche and the foie gras and nutella for dessert. \n\nThe dishes came out staggered, so we got to sit around chatting and enjoying ourselves and our cocktails. The charcuterie came out first. It was assorted sliced meats arranged on a wood plank and served with bread. It was actually really nice. Next was the horse tar tar. This was a stretch for me. I don't generally like to eat animals that I LIKE. The people I was with convinced me to try a small bit and I must say, it tasted pretty good, but on principle, I just have trouble with it. Sorry! I hate being one of those people who doesn't have a problem killing the \"ugly\" animals, but doesn't want the cute ones to die...but I am. \n\nNext was the bone marrow, which was....well let's just say I had to keep telling myself not to think about what I was eating. Basically, it's a big bone and the marrow is of course in the middle and has been cooked so that it's almost the consistency of warm butter...pretty fatty and oily looking. You scoop it out with a spoon and put it on bread. It's actually delicious, but feels like you're eating something you shouldn't, purely for health reasons if nothing else! It feels like eating pure fat....tastes as good I suppose. \n\nWe had the tongue on brioche, which I was only okay with. The tongue was sliced and presented as a sort of Montreal smoked meat. We were told to open it up and eat it like an open faced sandwich. This made it easier to split certainly. The meat itself was very tender and the brioche was great, but the meat had a horseradish (I think) sauce, which was a bit overpowering. \n\nFinally we had the tacos, which was probably the more \"normal\" thing we had. I actually thought those were my favorite. Wish it was one of the more exciting things, but nope. Those tacos were excellent. \n\nThe foie gras with nutella was also delicious. It was served on a banana bread, over a nutella spread...but the fois gras was superflous. It didn't add any taste and was overpowered but the nutella and basically didn't add anything to the dish. Could have been served without. Clearly just added to SAY it was there. \n\nSo what's the overall opinion? Well, the restaurant is too small. It's REALLY small, but popular. Wish it was in a bigger location. Sitting at the bar was kind of interesting, because all the cooking was done behind the bar, but that was a small workspace and it got hot, because the oven, dishwasher, stove top and so forth were always turned up very hight. Impressive how they work in such a space though.\n\nOverall the food was very good. SOMEONE knows what they are doing. However, it is quite a pricey place and as I said, sometimes the flavours overpower the meat, or the meat just isn't even necessary. Sometimes you're paying extra for fancy meat dishes that don't even need the meat, or where you can't TASTE the meat. \n\nThose are the only criticisms, but I wouldn't let that keep you from trying this place...but only if you're willing to go out on a limb a bit and as something different. This isn't a go-to place, but it's a fun place to have gone to! \n\nOh...PS - They don't accept credit cards. Only debit or cash.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Had heard good things, which is why we chose Second City, as opposed to the cheaper Bad Dog Theatre. \n\nI should mention that it was a lot less improv than I expected. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect, but it was basically, short, individual skits, creating a sort of sketch comedy act, as opposed to improv. This isn't a bad thing. I'm a HUGE fan of SNL, but I was say that I probably laughed more consistently during this performance, than your average episode of SNL. This is because of a combination of personal \"current Toronto\" jokes and because that's the way it should be when you have a couple of months to be putting together your next show, as opposed to one week (as with SNL). I would only expect a more refined show. In addition, we came close to the end of this show's run, so the kinks would presumably be figured out and they told us they were testing some of the new material on us, so that was kind of cool! \n\nThe skits were mostly successful, none failed to make us laugh out loud at least once. There were no weak links in terms of the actors, but the stand outs (for me) were a red headed girl and the black guy....sorry I have no names! I can only go by really obvious characteristics. \n\nWe stuck around after, as they did a little bit of actual improv and another skit, which seemed like an idea they were trying to hash out a little more. Well worth the sticking around even later for!\n\nWhy the lack of one star? Well those pictures down below don't really accurately describe what this place looks like when it's full of people. The chairs are small, there is no coat check and you're all crammed around a very small table.

My skirt made it so that I kept sliding off the seat! I asked if there was any way we could be moved into regular seats, but the only thing left (and this is how I know seats are prearranged, because there were tonnes of empty seats all around at that time), were right in the front, next to the stage, but to the far side. From this angle, you can't see everything, but we enjoyed it more being right up, near the action. \n\nThat said, it was still VERY crowded and uncomfortable. Tickets are $30 each (here is a tip...it's a little less if you have a CAA membership and order through them), so that's pretty pricey. The show makes it worth it, it truly does. The seating takes away from it. \n\nBUT you can order drinks, which we did and that make just about anything better, so hey! \n\nAt the end of the day, I'll just make sure I wear pants next time and order tickets further in advance and either way it won't stop me from checking out another performance. It's worth a night of non-stop laughter.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

This is a challenge, because you can't see the food and because even when you THINK you've finally speared a veggie, for example, when you bring the fork to your mouth, you realized you've lost it somewhere along the way. Usually into your lap. \n\nThis is DEFINITELY an experience, does an interesting job at raising awareness, but here are my issues with this place: The food was good, but not great.

This was distinctly forgettable food. \n\nI would have liked to see the room we were in at the end of the meal. YES, I know this would require everyone eating at the same time, no new people entering, but I was a little sketched out about never seeing where I was.

It's boring. The booths had gaps where the seat meets with the wooden bench part that holds the seat part up. Hard to describe, but looks cheap and crappy, like they're broken. Our table was very unbalanced and the waitress came and stuck a coaster under it so it would stop rocking. It's small and very cramped. \n\nFood: Selection was pretty standard pub fare, but a bit on the expensive side. I ordered a chicken curry dish and when they asked if I wanted it to be spicy or mild I asked for it to be mild. Either their mild is just VERY spicy and I would hate to try their actual spicy, or they made a mistake. The curry comes with the chicken in sauce, rice and a sort of fried crisp, which was nice. The rice was bland however...or the spice from the curry killed my tastebuds. \nMy husband chose a burger, which was overall very good, although they charged him two dollars each for bacon and cheese on the burger, which is expensive when your burger is already $15. Not sure the bacon added anything, but the cheese, I'll admit was really good on this burger. \n\nAtmosphere and Service: Service was fine. BUT, since this seems to be a trend...or the gods are intent on making me detest children while eating out, we had another loud, rude child\/negligent parent situation (see post on Malaysian place).

The group of older individuals across from us kept leaning over to make comments to us and the two ladies nearby grumbled under their breath. \n\nOnce again, this was a problem that could easily have been solved by the restaurant. The kids were part of a party and were in a party room, which is adjacent, but separate from the rest of the dining room. This room had doors on it...which CLOSE, but were propped wide open. All the waitress had to do was go and quietly shut the doors. That's it! Problem solved. \n\nWe were getting annoyed and so we didn't bother ordering dessert. Too bad, because they actually looked great. The group across from us ordered a few and were commenting on how good they were.\n\nSo yeah...I actually would have given this pub 2 stars even without the screaming kid, but if the screaming kid had not been a problem, we probably would have stayed for dessert and who knows, maybe these guys would be getting 3+ stars.

Granted there are only 4 as I am writing this, but still they seemed pretty consistent. \n\nWe have driven by this place a million times and never given it a second glance, but based on the reviews, off we went to give it a try.\n\nFirst impressions were pretty good. We were seated right away in a large booth. The restaurant was clean and modern looking, although covered in Halloween decorations, despite it being November 10. \n\nMenu looked pretty good, with lots of selection. The front of the menu is the desserts, which seem to be why most people come here. But we wanted dinner as well. I ordered the shrimp wonton soup and my husband ordered chicken and mushrooms with rice. \n\nWe both ordered drinks. I ordered a tea and my husband ordered a mango smoothie. \n\nMy drink came out...then my soup came out...neither of my husbands orders came. It took another fifteen minutes for his food to come and his drink came after that! No apologies for the wait. \n\nMy soup was pretty basic. The noodles had no taste and a sticky texture. It was bland overall, but not terrible. My drink was good, but small, given the $6 price tag for a tea. \n\nMy husbands dish was just gross. The chicken were little balls that looked like chicken fetuses. Maybe they were?? Filled with bones, making them very difficult to eat. The taste was bland and salty. \n\nHis drink was good, but the straw didn't reach to the bottom of the glass...which wasn't a glass at all, but a wine decanter. He couldn't reach his drink about half-way through and had to borrow my straw.\n\nWe finished our meals and started waiting...and waiting and waiting. No one had come to check and see how our meals were and we had to flag someone down to clear the dishes. A girl finally came to go it and did so without looking, or asking if there was anything else she could get for us, or if we wanted refills. \n\nWe REALLY wanted to give this place the benefit of the doubt, so we decided to stick it out and order dessert, since it seemed to be what this place was all about. \n\nWe flagged someone down and ordered mixed fruit on a waffle. The presentation of the dish was certainly nice, but it's pretty generic. It's a basic belgian waffle with vanilla ice cream, strawberries, bananas and some melon balls and cool whip whipped cream on top and a sort of Aunt Jemima syrup. \n\nIt was pretty good, but nothing special.\n\nOnce we finished we flagged someone down to get our bill. He said yes and left...and never came back. We saw his give other people bills and get food...he basically completely forgot about us. We waited for 15 minutes. We started looking around to figure out what happened and noticed that the wait staff were just chilling in the back of the restaurant. One girl was staring aimlessly at the ceiling. Two others were holding hands and swinging their arms in time to the music. Two guys were back there chatting away...it was actually weird. \n\nFinally, we managed to flag down yet a DIFFERENT waitress...this was number 6 (one seated us, one took our order, one cleared the dishes, one took the dessert order and one went to get our bill...apparently, and now this one) and asked her to get our bill. She finally did. We paid...we left a tip (we try hard not be be jerks, even if the service is poor) and left...never to return. \n\nSo yeah, bland food, generic desserts and TERRIBLE service = not worth it. \n\nOne another note, another review says, \"If you're into young asian girls (and guys), this is the place to hang out.\" I KNOW this person meant nothing by this comment, but I swear there is some creepy dude who has done a Google search of \"Places where young Asian girls and boys hang out\" and found this place based on that review...so you know...probably some creepers hanging around as well. Just sayin'! (*Note: This comment, as creepy as it was, had no baring on my review).","useful":1,"funny":3,"cool":1}

Since I have been several times and never had a bad experience, I can only give my review of this place based on what I have experienced. \n\nThat said, it seems like so many people have experienced bad service, that even I am wary of this place now. I have never been during \"peak\" hours, which may account for more attentive service.\n\nAs mentioned, I have been to this restaurant several times and really enjoyed myself. I love Mexican food and there doesn't seem to be enough good Mexican restaurants around, so I get excited when I find one with food I enjoy.\n\nI have had their nachos, two types of tacos and a burrito at this place and enjoyed all of them. When I went with a girlfriend, we were advised to get two taco plates and share them, since they give you a few, small tacos on each plate. We did this and really enjoyed both dishes. \n\nThe nachos were also great, having been piled high with toppings, not just your grated cheese and some tomatoes. \n\nDrinks were also good. I guess my one criticism would be the price, which I do think is a little high given that Mexican food is quite cheap to produce. I am guessing that the extra cost goes towards the atmosphere, which is trendy...but I gave this same review to another Mexican restaurant I went to in Florida and it looked like someone's kitchen, so I guess it's all in the eye of the beholder.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":2}

The drummers just sort of jam together, playing all sorts of different types of drums and bongos. People go and dance in the middle...kids go and pound on the drums...lots of people get high! \n\nEven not high, this is a pretty fun thing to watch. It's mesmerizing somehow. Again, I can't explain what made this so great.

Actually, it's better that it's not. I would get truly obese if it were, because my new diet would consist of fried dough, sauce and cheese.\nMy husband and myself went to Sail and were looking for a place to pick up some dinner...just grab and go, since I had no groceries at home...but also didn't have the energy to go grocery shopping. I lay in a hammock (I was in Sail, what else would I do?) I researched places to get sandwiches in the area and this place came up and had good reviews. I mentioned to my husband as we were checking out and the check out guy said, \"There is this good place nearby named Ricci's.\" That sealed the deal. Off we went.\n\nThe outside is hardly something to look at. The sign is faded and dirty and it looks, outside, like it's a dive. We went in a saw a modestly busy place, clean and a HUGE menu. You can eat in (seating is limited and similar to fast food seating), can get delivery, or get take out. \n\nThe menu is extensive, with pasta, pizza and panzerotti. We went with what many people were raving about online and got panzerotti...fried ones. OH GOD HEART ATTACK. We also got the rice balls.\n\nOkay, rice balls first: Lightly breaded, gooey cheese on the inside and sauce for dipping them in....SO GOOD.\n\nThe panzerotti...well this is where they lose one star...not on the food itself, but because they messed up our order. One order was covered in a sheet of wax paper with the toppings listed on the inside...it was mine. But after a few bites I noticed, I was actually eating my husband's. We switched and then i noticed there were no toppings in mine at all! Just cheese and sauce. So they were mislabelled AND the order was messed up. \n\nBut OH LORDY, was that a great panzerotti anyway. Just melt in your mouth awesome....and that's after a 30 minute drive home! \n\nI called up Ricci's and explained what happened and said I was too far away to come in again or to have something delivered and they gave me a credit for the panzerotti. The girl on the phone apologized and was very polite. So they fixed the problem to the best of their ability and it was amazingly delicious. Next time if I go back and the order it great...and not messed up, I think I'll have to bump these guys up another star! \n\nOhhhh man, get me BACK there!","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0}

When they didn't I assumed our drink cups would be brought to us at the table. They weren't.

My girlfriend said it was almost overpowering in the restroom. It was a really sickly sweet smell. I'm not sure what it was but it didn't make the burgers taste any better.\n\nHere it is several hours later and I'm a little bit queasy. Not sure if it was the burger, but I haven't eaten anything else today. \n\nIf it comes back up I'll change my review to a 1 for now I'll stick with my 2 star review.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

All the workers I interacted with were friendly; one of the Gucci workers actually helped point me in the right direction when I was disoriented (it's a big store!), and we joked a little.  Overall, it was a very pleasant experience.\n\nAnd in terms of Macy's in Las Vegas, this is definitely the best one.  Next time I go to Macy's, it'll be this one.  The underground parking is a little disorienting if you've never been before, but park near an escalator (they're color-coded - very handy!), and you'll be a-okay.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":1}

I hadn't experienced your brand of deep fried crap since I came of majority and stopped dined out with the family at restaurants that specialized in satisfying even the blandest of palettes. I must say, you continue to exceed my wildest expectations in that respect! I had to continue looking down at my plate just to make sure the 3,000+ calories I was consuming were more than just a mirage of Mexican food.\n\nI will admit that I have a long standing, simmering hatred for you, Macayo's. So maybe this biases my opinion a bit. I can't in my right mind fathom why I thought you deserved a second chance last night. I think it's testament to the fact that sometimes I make super stupid decisions on an empty stomach, especially when I'm hungry enough to eat the ass end out of week dead burro. I suppose I was expecting something a bit more appetizing than that stretch of hyperbole. How wrong I was.\n\nYour patio was the highlight of the evening. It's backed up against a lake and there was a duck that watched me eat. He had a shiny green head. It was nice. I made him my zen when all I wanted to do was lash out in frustration over the meal. If I could offer a suggestion to benefit both the duck and myself, perhaps you could pipe some music out onto the patio, because listening to Suzie and Sally Suburb bitch about their waistlines while committing refried sin was pretty grating.\n\nThe food however, far outshone those cackling soccer moms in terms of annoyance. I don't know who you think you are, Macayo's, but charging 10-15 bucks an entree at your establishment just about gave me a heart attack long before the lard had a chance to bully up on my arteries. Maybe it's because I think you have the street value of a gum job from a run down whore, but I have to say that those prices were shocking. I could travel the valley over and find better Mexican food for much cheaper. For that price, I expect outstanding quality and taste, or at least a hip see and be seen environment. All you have is a duck working in your favor. \n\nI do have a serious question for you though, what's with smothering your entrees in cream cheese and trying to pass it off as Baja sauce? It was the same jalapeno spread I get on my bagel in the morning, but with even less heat and flavor. I suggest renaming it Manhattan sauce in honor of the bagel and schmear capital of the nation, and I think it would be a touching homage to the Pace Picante \"New York City?!\" commercials. \n\nI also can't understand why the majority of your entrees offer either rice or beans, but few have these in conjunction. Those are universal standards at a Mexican food joint, and the ultimate test of quality since they're comparable the valley over. Do they bring you shame? Is that why you don't want to offer them both? Or are you just a cheap nickel and diming motherfucker, Macayo's? \n\nI'm more apt to believe the latter, because you charged me two bucks for guacamole without informing me that it cost extra. Then you delivered a pile of gelatinous green goop of questionable origin that had absolutely zero flavor. By this point in the meal I really shouldn't have been surprised at how bland everything was, because I was on to your ploy of substituting flavor for gobs of cream cheese and a heavy hand with the salt shaker. But despite stiff competition from the bland pico de gallo and the puzzling \"Baja sauce\", it was the shitamole took the grad prize of suckdom for the evening. I have never tasted weaker guac. You must have used some terrible avocados and whipped them with corn syrup or some other food-like filler. There wasn't a zing of cilantro or lemon juice, no hint of Serrano spiciness, not even the tang of some onion, although I did see a couple soggy tomatoes bits added for color. \n\nI don't think I will ever be coming back, Macayo's. It's not you, it's... I can't lie; even to spare your feelings. It's you. It's all you. I'm breaking up in a public setting because I'm scared that you'll key my car while by back is turned, or at the least smother it in cream cheese. I know you're into that freaky shit.\n\nWishing you deep fried broken dreams,\nErica","useful":14,"funny":29,"cool":14}

Weird.\n\nBut what this little place lacks in ambiance, it makes up for in food. I had a tuna melt on rye that was to die for. Anyone who knows me can vouch for the fact that I believe the tuna melt to be a sandwich of the gods. Fuck ambrosia. They were eating warm albacore over buttery, crisp bread, smothered in cheddar cheese and pan fried to perfection. And the fries were sprinkled with some kind of magic pixie dust that endowed them with the ability to make me profusely salivate.\n\nEveryone at the table ordered something different (from the hot roast beef dinner to the fried fish, Caesar salad to the pork fritter sandwich) and it was agreed that all entrees were wicked, fricken good. And breakfast is served all day long. Super score!\n\nSo go, pay homage to John Wayne, and he shall reward you with some good eats!","useful":10,"funny":8,"cool":4}

The jerk was smoky, spicy, and highlighted the chicken instead of overpowering it. Same sides, so at least we didn't have to fight over those. \n\nMake sure to try the hibiscus flower drink (sorrel) with cloves floating in it.

The eclectic and bold paint decorating the walls is very reminiscent of the Caribbean, and the faux-rattan chairs help with the vibe too. There's also a couch against one side of the restaurant that is kind of out of place, but who am I to judge decor?

It was my father's birthday and I couldn't think of a thing to get the most unhelpful man ever. \"Whatta you want? Whatever. Like what? You don't have to get me anything.\" Oh, but I do.\n\nMy beacon of hope was tucked away in a tiny little strip mall, sandwiched by a Dunkin' Donuts, a Japanese food mart and a liquor store, with a simple sign advertising, \"Irish Gifts.\" Salvation! He's all about heraldry and Irish pride, but would the offerings be too chotchke to actually give anyone? Like leprechaun print boxers and Kiss Me I'm Irish ties he'd only wear one day during the year? \n\nNope. This place is a class act. \n\nWhen I first entered the store I was shocked at how much stuff they had crammed onto the floor space. It would have been claustrophobic had they not utilized barriers (also decorated with stuff) that lead you into different areas of the store. The owners also run the place and immediately greeted me. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised at the wide variety of Irish themed offerings. They had everything from the goofy offerings I had imagined to beautiful jewelry, china and crystal ware. They even had a whole section of imported Irish food, including tea, sweets and refrigerated stuff like sausages. He ended up with some glassware with decorative pewter insignias ranging from Celtic knots to Claddagh rings. \n\nThe people who own it are friendly and immediately helpful in finding anything you need, ordering what they don't have or calling the competition to see if they can secure that special something, something I appreciate. I've been frequenting the place since, snatching up Guinness themed merchandise for friends and fun Irish gifts for other members of my family. My dad even purchased his wedding rings from the place and a lovely Celtic cake topper of a man and woman with knot work circling it.\n\nThe prices are a wee bit steep, but they won't have your wallet crying out in protest. And for imported goods at a specialty shop, it's completely understandable. \n\nDon't forget to sign up for the Shamacus (shamrock-cactus! nyuk, nyuk!), a newsletter that arrives quarterly or so with all sorts of recipies, stories, and specials on their merchandise.

They used to have a ton of wine here as well (like, ages ago) but it has since been narrowed down to just four choices, none of which were calling my name this last go round. Their Orange Blossom wheat beer was a bit like drinking an orange creamsicle in beer form. Almost like a cider with floral notes, a light finish and a super creamy mouthfeel. (Oh yeah, bitches. I just went there.) The perfect beer for the novice drinker to enjoy. Their IPA was also pretty decent, but was more bitter than I care for, although it stayed far away from feeling like I was drinking a bottle of grassy perfume. Solid.\n\nI thought they had deals on happy hour food (again, like a buck off) but last time I went it was no dice. At least the food's reasonably priced. Tasty rueben, craptastic hummus, crispy quesadilla. \n\nThe acoustics in this place are kind of shitty, so go on an off time when it won't be packed, or run the risk of smiling and nodding amicably while hearing every other snippet of convo.

It's a little bit on the pricey side though, so take advantage of the happy hour and half-priced sangria Sundays.\n\nIt used to be a tiny, homey little cafe next to Long Wong's at 7th Street and Mill and has since been converted into a spacious, classy winery and Italian bistro at 4th Street and Mill.\n\nHappy hour specials are only extended to the bar area, which is tiny in comparison to the rest of the area. There's the traditional happy hour from 5 to 7, and a reverse happy hour that begins after 10 pm. (Check which days this is available though, because I'm not sure it's daily.) Draft beers like Guiness and Harp are two bucks, wine by the glass is half off (3 to 6 bucks after the discount), as are their fancy pants cocktails (generally 5 bucks)--the espresso martini is decadent--and all appetizers aside from the huge cheese plate are half priced. One wonky thing about the tab for happy hour is that they take the discount off at the end, so just keep a running tab in your head of how much you owe if you're with a group to make things go a little smoother.\n\nI'm in lust with the Shrimp Adriatico, which is an appetizer that has five big tiger shrimp swimming in garlic tomato sauce that's served with a loaf of bread for dipping. It's filling enough to serve as an entire meal, or to share among friends.\n\nOn Sundays, pitchers of sangria are half priced ($15 instead of $30) and are a refreshing way to relax with a group of friends in the afternoon. I prefer the white wine over the red because it compliments the freshly sliced apples and muddled citrus. Make sure to ask them to go easy on the cinnamon though, or you may end up with an overpowering flavor and chalky texture.\n\nDinner is always divine as well, but a little bit on the pricey side. The meals are huge though, so you're pretty much guaranteed leftovers or you can split an entre with another person for an extra 3 buck charge. The Voodoo Penne is a delicious Cajun flavored dish, Lucas' Meatballs are savory and filling, and the Pola Pola is some awesome artichoke ravioli. Everything is done well and I rarely encounter problems with the servers or bartenders.\n\nIt's a nice, mellow break from the hubbub of Mill Avenue.\n\n***UPDATE***\nI've been a little peeved lately at the happy hour, since it's only extended to the bar and the bar is so damn tiny. Now I understand that if I don't get there around 5 I have no chance of getting a seat. That's fine.

Fuck you and your scrumtious, mouth watering 19 dollar spaghetti and meatballs. They're fucking meatballs, Boa! Plus your half price on glasses of wine less than 10 bucks is a pretty useless deal now. Jeezy creezy.\n\nThis isn't goodbye though.

When it comes to dinner, you don't want a wonderbread palate (\"Um, I don't eat anything green...\") influencing the meal. Chef Christopher is a dynamo in the kitchen, and you need to leave that one man show plenty of room to create his masterpieces. No exaggeration, his dishes are crazy delicious masterpieces. It's like having your own personal top chef customizing something just for you.\n\nThe fact that this place is BYOB makes my heart smile.

A much more European approach to lingering and enjoying the food, drink and atmosphere. It will take you a couple hours to get through everything from initial seat and greet with the chef (who doubles as the waiter\/busser\/todos!) to your last scrumptious bite. Totally worth every minute of waiting. Also, you might not want to come here starvin marvin.

I work too far from just about every hummus slinging place in Tempe but Byblos. So I decided to try something new, and was left with a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nFirst off, the place is located in a shitty plaza of decaying shops (home to the Yucca Tap Lounge if that's any indication) and it's right next door to a Mexican food restaurant that I've never seen anyone enter or leave, so it looks like a front for some shady 'business' dealings. But my craving would not be deterred by a craptastic plaza, after all, Capistrano's is in the same plaza and it's delicious. Looks aren't everything. Hummus would be had.\n\nWe enter. It's empty and dumpy looking. The only people here have a mean age of 70. We significantly bring this average down. Waaaay down. We are escorted to a table and peruse the menu. The server (I assume it's the unfriendly server you had, Kelly B., because he looked like he had a stick up his ass that had been festering there for the past 60 years) took our drink orders and came back with two itsy bitsy little cups. Seriously? You're going to charge me 2.50 for six ounces of lemonade? We order. He frowns for the umpteenth time in our short interaction and waddles off to the kitchen. The food arrives.\n\nThe hummus was straight up GROSS, and the pita bread was shockingly similar to cardboard. The hummus tasted sour with a texture that was a combination between chalk and paste. If I can corner a five year old, I'm going to conduct a taste test between the two substances and see if there's any discernable difference. My money's on no. The presentation was nice, with pickles, tomatoes, olive oil and parsley, but if I wrap a piece of dried up dog shit in ribbons and bows, your gift would still be a piece of dried up dog shit. Maybe you could use it as a paper weight? \n\nThe tomato soup that came along with lunch was pretty decent,and the gyro meat was well spiced. But the fact that my gyro was wrapped in the aforementioned cardboard pita bread was really unappetizing. It's like they took rock hard, stale pita bread, heated it in the microwave to make it pliable, molded it and let it cool in its rigid formation. \n\nSo if you're 70 and your senses are slowly numbing, you might like this place. Other than that, stay away. It's unwelcoming and unappetizing. The antithesis of what a restaurant should be. Let it slowly decay along with the rest of the shops lining this creepy little plaza at the corner of Mill and Southern.","useful":12,"funny":16,"cool":7}

It was solid, but nothing to write home about. The al pastor tasted overly smoky and there was a strange tinge of sweetness underlying the pork flavor, while the carne asada was good but nothing a dozen other 'Bertos clones couldn't pound out. And I'm sorry, but $2.25 is pricey for one bitsy taco. I could almost get two tacos for the same price at my other taco dives.\n\nThe elote was also disappointing. I understand that it's \"America's corn\" and their spin on it, but there was zero chile or lime flavor to the corn. It was very tender but totally slathered in mayo and powdery cheese. I added some lime and chile spice with their dipping sauce, but it was still just so-so. \n\nI'm a taco fiend so I'm giving these guys the benefit of the doubt with three stars (when I really want to give them two).

The atmosphere, product, service, and baked goods have seduced me with their simple elegance. The only gripe I possibly have about this place is the fact that the parking lot is the size of a matchbox, and with Sacks, Cafe Lalibella and Starbucks all occupying the same plaza, finding a place to park during the busy lunch rush is like simultaneously playing Tetris and Frogger.\n\nThe atmosphere at Essence is understated in its sophistication. Windows line the majority of the dining room, creating an inviting, open air feeling and the attached patio is charming. Strong earth toned colors and cute little origami flower bouquets grace the tables. Despite the small size of the establishment there are a variety of seating options for single patrons or small groups, and I've never seen people waiting for a table, even during their busiest Friday lunch rush.\n\nA broad array of patrons frequent Essence including hipsters, young professionals, older adults in their power suits, and even a few elders. I haven't seen very many college kids, which may because the food isn't cheap and it's probably \"weirder\" than options on Mill's strip. But I dig the \"weird\" French inspired cuisine. It's decadent and I feel naughty eating it.\n\nEverything I've eaten during lunch has been exceptional. The croque moniseur is far and away the best thing I've tried so far. A grilled sandwich with an egg washed top layer, thin sliced ham, creamy gruyere cheese and jalapenos. It's heavenly crunchy, just as the name suggests. The open face steak sandwich is tender delicious and smothered in buttery sauteed mushrooms with a sprinkle of bleu cheese crumbles as a savory accent. The layers of phyllo dough used in the spanakopita demonstrates some serious painstaking dedication to producing a good product, and the chopped Greek salad was phenomenal. Crispy cucumbers, bell peppers, kalmata olives, feta cheese and tomatoes that tasted like, well, actual tomatoes, for once. Something that you don't often find and an indication that Essence uses amazingly fresh organic product whenever possible. Even the side of potato salad with whole grain mustard was exceptional.\n\nThe offerings at their bakery are just as phenomenal as their lunch entrees. The caramel creme macaroon is seriously the most amazing sandwich cookie I've ever tasted, a perfect harmony between savory creme filling and sweet chewy wafers. The strawberry shortcake is amazingly fresh and light, if not a little hard to eat. And their white chocolate raspberry layer cake is the classiest Little Debbie-esque snack cake I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. One day I vow to pick up a box of \"Tasty little treats\" just so I can sample a cupcake and about three cookies without having to choose among all the desserts on display!\n\nI highly recommend this place.

But it's the pizza that's the big star here and I don't know if it's just me but it seems like there's been a slow but noticeable decline in its quality. Less toppings, burnt crust more often than not, cheese that seems to congeal in the five minutes it takes to go from box to mouth. They used to have a lot more hot sandwich and a drink specials too. Chicken parm, cordon bleu, meatball subs, all delicious! Just not offered with as much regularity or in as plentiful a portion as they used to be. \n\nPlus, and this might be a personal beef, but the drink that came with the two slices special has been scaled back to a much smaller cup. Have the extra couple gulps of soda per transaction really translated to that much of an increase in syrup costs?

It has the best patio in all of Tempe, nay all of Phoenix, no--history. Alright, probably not history. I mean, if there were a bar in the middle of some wicked beautiful natural reserve, I'm sure it would trump Casey's. But I'm not qualifying their worth based on beauty. (Sorry, dearest. I'll make sure to spend freely this weekend to make up for that slight.) The five stars it gets is based on the general relaxing vibe it exudes.\n\nIt's far enough off the Mill Avenue strip that the douchebaggery of those bars rarely flows over into Casey's. I've seen that the only gripe most people have with this bar is the occasional frat boy that wanders onto the patio, but even though these specimens in their natural environment are prone to swinging their dicks and strutting with impunity, they act different once they're surrounded by the regular clientele. The regulars could care less that you're the beer pong champion or top sorority sex kitten, can you engage in a meaningful conversation? No? Then kindly take your bulging biceps and stilettos to Scottsdale, where you're sure to be appreciated.\n\nI love the fact that this bar attracts such a broad range of people, all of whom coexist in an atmosphere of mutual respect and happy drunkenness. The elderly come here for the oysters, the hipsters come here to show off their newest tattoo. ASU professors coexist with high school dropouts. Professional bar hoppers chit chat with weekend warriors. The food's pretty wicked as well. \n\nFrench onion soup, the Hippie Sandwich, the Tuna Bacon Melt, the Fishwich (without bread it just becomes fish and chips, but way cheaper), the Oysters Rockefeller, the Chipotle Chicken Wings, the Clamstrip basket at 5 bucks a pop...it's greasy and divine. The prices aren't absurd, but are a little on the steep side for bar food, but it's totally worth it. And if you go for happy hour, there are free munchies inside near the dart board.\n\nIt's a lovely little pub with a great patio, friendly servers and decent drink prices. Go there often enough and I'm sure its subtle charm will capture your fancy (and your wallet), just as it has countless others.\n\nDearest Casey Moore, you hold a place in my heart and although my liver denies it, she thinks you're pretty cool too.","useful":5,"funny":7,"cool":5}

I'm in my twenties but I still wanted one of those little card stock car boxes, even if my taste in toppings has become a bit more adventurous.\n\nJust because my tastebuds have matured doesn't make me any more decisive now than I was then. Not a good thing with a place that boasts 50 or so toppings for you burger (or chicken sandwich, or salad-- they're all based on the same \"every order is a special order\" model).

It's all about the meat. It was messy and juices were dripping all over my face, and I must have gone through at least four paper towels, but hot diggity damn, it was a great burger.\n\nThe smallest burger possible (the Classic) is about five ounces or so and they increase incrementally until you reach the big mamba jamba 20 ounce 'nother nail in the coffin coronary on a bun.

And this year I totally neglected to get Mr. Man so much as a card. Dog house! (I thought we weren't celebrating! How was I to know that little sneaker was would bring a smile to my face with a cutesy, cheesy, tchotchky gift and card combo?)\n\nLittle did he know that I had an ace up my sleeve. An ace with lots and lots of titacular action. Bombshells! I know that nothing brings a smile to Mr. Man's face quicker than a pair of boobies, so we stopped by on Sunday for some sinful indulgence in an illusionary atmosphere. Being a non-traditionalist doesn't have to be a bad thing.\n\nSundays are 2 for 1 well drinks and domestic bottles before 7 pm, which is nice when it's $7.75 for a short gin and tonic. There's also no cover, an indication that Sunday nudity lures some guys that are reminiscent of your dad. Expect gentlemen in kahki shorts and button down shirts paying to have a lady rub their bits all over. But at least these gents are better business than the twenty-somethings that just watched the entire time, not a dollar bill in sight. Skeeze. \n\nIt's pretty easy to see which girls are enjoying themselves up there (or at least doing a good job faking it) and who's bored as all get out. We had some very enthusiastic ladies, especially after the shift change at 6pm, and they totally knew how to work the pole in their seven inch heels. Don't come here expecting tig ole fake bitties you usually encounter at Skin or other Scottsdale places. These ladies are au natural and I wouldn't have it any other way. \n\nWhat's nicest was this fact that they're willing to sit down and chat with you regardless of whether you're interested in a lap dance or not:\nLovely buxom brunette: \"What are you and your girlfriend celebrating?\"\nMr. Man: *baffled, blank stare* \"Sunday?\"\nLBB: \"Wow! She's a keeper. Hold on to that one!\"\n\nOfficially out of the dog house.\n\nIt's not a brusque, all-business attitude at Bombshells and even though I was the only girl there that wasn't on shift (aside from an awkward couple that came in scowling, stayed for three songs and booked it), there's no awkwardness about it. And since I'm a woman I get the supremely sexy treatment instead of the perfunctory titty shake when I tip.\n\nThe icing on our lecherous evening? Mr. Man got a lap dance and the Italian beauty offered to do a couple's one for no extra charge. Now that's class. \n\nMaybe I'm too harsh on the whole 'tradition' thing.

I was driving to Carlsbad Tavern when the clouds unleashed buckets upon buckets of rain on my car. By the time I got there the rain had subsided to a drizzle and it made for the absolute perfect atmosphere as I walked up the wooden planks into the cave-like atmosphere of Carlsbad Tavern.\n\nBut then I looked to the right and saw an empty lagoon with tchotchke plastic turtles and fish upended and scattered atop PVC pipes in the concrete enclosure. I can accept the fact that they wouldn't keep that filled during the summer though. It's a waste of water with all the evaporation, although I'd really like to come here when the waterfall moat thingy is functioning because it looks like it would be great ambiance for a fun dinner!\n\nI got there 15 minutes late and ended up having to wait another 15 minutes for my mom and aunt to arrive (what can I say, we're a punctual family). So I sauntered up to the bar and ordered a margarita on the rocks with salt. Since it was on happy hour it cost me only $3.75 and was a smooth combination of tequila, triple sec and sweet and sour mix. For only four bucks this well concoction was one of the better margaritas in recent memory. Chile pepper lights around the bar with all sorts of bat related memorabilia managed to be campy fun rather than campy trashy and gave me plenty to observe as I was waiting.\n\nFeeling like the traditional Mexican munchies, I ordered the tricolor chips with two salsas. This was an unfortunate choice. The salsa de casa was very coarsely chopped, which made it really hard to dip or spoon onto a chip, and was extremely heavy on tomatoes with few other discernable flavors. The tomatillo salsa tasted okay but was also chopped so coarsely it was like layering strips of tomatillo on chips. The chips weren't too bad, but they were reminiscent of oil they've been using to crisp chimichangas in for the past week. I've worked in food service and I know what old oil tastes like.\n\nBut the conversation with my aunt and mom more than made up for the disappointing appetizer, and it cost two whopping bucks so I totally got what I paid for, although it is a little disappointing that they don't come complimentary.\n\nOnce we were seated in the main dining room, I was pleased by the atmosphere and decor (stuffed bats hanging from the ceiling! high seat booths with comfy cushions! cool copper light fixtures! rock walls and a huge floor to ceiling rock feature with vegetation!), which managed to maintain a cave-like atmosphere while still being inviting. We placed our order with a very friendly server that was a natural at making small talk and joking around, instead of coming off as peeved that we were taking too long to examine The Daily Guano. I also liked the more open ended, \"Is there anything I can do for you?\" Rather than the usual leading questions like, \"Can I get you something to drink? Do you know what you want to eat?\"\n\nI ordered the Enchantment Platter so I could try a little bit of everything, a chicken enchilada, carne adovada burrito, a chile rellano and a sopapilla. When it came out I was pretty disappointed by the presentation. It was smothered in so much sauce and cheese that it was difficult to discern just what the hell I had on my plate and it looked like my burrito had anointed the surrounding items with a liberal splash of greasy red sauce. It most definitely could have done with two plates instead of just one. \n\n(I'll admit it. It really, really pissed me off. That gut reaction made me want to rate this place around 2 stars instead of 4. I have issues with food presentation. I rearrange every sandwich I order at a restaurant to ensure even distribution of ingredients. I don't care if things are touching and mixing it up, but it better be doing so in an aesthetic manner.)\n\nBut once I dug in it turned out to be a delicious meal! The chicken enchilada with tomatillo and green chile was deliciously cheesy with huge chunks of chicken. The carne adovada was tender but relied a bit too heavily on some weird tomato flavor that was thickened with what tasted like cornstarch, solo it was weird, but when the burrito entrails leaked all over the place it added a delicious flavor to the meal. The chile rellano was pure pork and cheese, a dense and delicious concoction nested atop rice and black bean. Rice was generic, black beans were delish. And I've got enough leftovers for three lunches, all for only $12.95! \n\nPsst! Don't get the habenero burger unless you want to shit fire for the next week. I've heard that from so many people that it must be true! It's not served with a complementary glass of milk for no reason...","useful":7,"funny":4,"cool":7}

You just bubbled in a smiley face on your scantron sheet? Well why not change your answer now, just a little substitute. Oh you charge a minimum of a dollar for any substitute or deviation from your menu. That's straight up retarded. I'm relegating you to the short bus for the remainder of term.\n\nI see that you also have a tiny clause that states you're at liberty to add an 18% gratuity to any order. How very sneaky of you to not define the terms of that. So you're a trouble maker too? I'll be keeping my eye on you.\n\nA strict \"No Cellphones\" policy? Interesting idea, but the place is so obnoxiously loud that I don't see the cause for such a stipulation, and since we only saw our waitress in passing, I can't fathom that it's out of respect for her. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't think you've fully developed that theme. Rework that passage and turn it back in by Monday for full credit.\n\nThat brings me to my next point, OPH. It's a great idea to have a wide variety of friends, from brodogs and scottstiudes to old folks and families out for brunch. It's really nice to see you making an effort to make everyone feel included, but your waitstaff, they're crappy, hon. Terse, perfunctory, and cold, like little automatons they whir around the restaurant. Order. Better hope you don't need anything else. Human feelings are not programmed into their model. Eat. Now get out. There are people waiting for your seat. Repeat.\n\nAnd what gives you the gall to think you can charge $4.25 for three pieces of dinky bacon? OPH, I'm really disappointed in you. Since you don't allow any substitutions and since none of your entrees come with any sides (aside from massive amounts of carb-y, bland pancakes), you're practically forcing people to order certain menu items a la carte. Your food is overpriced as it is. Breakfast for two cost us 35 bucks, and we didn't even get that much food. For shame. I'm assigning you Saturday detention for the remainder of the month. Maybe that'll teach you some respect.\n\nNow let's move on to your coursework. The food that you delivered was actually quite good. I had the Eggs Michael (even though I would have liked to substitute Canadian bacon, I couldn't justify the ridiculous extra charge on an already pricey entree) with four thin potato pancakes. The yolks of the poached eggs created a lovely little dipping sauce, the sausage beneath it jujitsu'd my taste buds to smithereens with its awesomosity, and the English muffin base was crispity and delicious. The accompanying mushroom sauce...what is the term you kids use today...sucked big dangly donkey balls. A flavorless white sauce with canned mushroom floating around looking bored with their lot in life. I can't justify cream sauce unless it's good, and your gravy sucked those donkey balls blue, OPH. The potato pancakes more than made up for the crappy sauce though. Thin little hashbrown patties with sour cream and applesauce! Yum!\n\nMr. Man ordered the spinach crepes with a side order of homefries and redonkulously overpriced bacon. The homefries were the only stand out aspect of that meal. The spinach filling was soggy, had more tasteless canned mushrooms filler (even came complete with the bland mushroom dipping crap) and I could taste none of the cheese you claimed was there. Quite disappointing, OPH. You did your homework at the last minute on that one, didn't you?\n\nIt's clear that you have potential. However since your grade is cumulative, I'm going to have to give you a C. Tut, tut, tut, no complaining. You earned it.","useful":13,"funny":16,"cool":11}

It's sweet and vinegary and weird and ruins perfectly good smoked meat. But the last two times I've been out for this kind of food, I have been pleasantly surprised. Maybe as I age my appreciation for tangy tomato sugar paste matures. I'm a classy broad like that. Or maybe I just need to frequent places that know how to serve up barbeque right, and that's exactly what Urban Campfire does.\n\nThey couldn't have chosen a better location for the restaurant, within walking distance of the University, and I'm wicked pleased that nasty fucking Greasy Tony's finally crawled into its dingy little hole and died. I don't even want to know how much cleaning they had to undertake in order to reincarnate the tiny little shithole as a sparkling and inviting little diner. \n\nAfter swinging by this little place on a Monday night to see it closed, I was bummed and a little skeptical that it would be open at 8:00 on a Sunday evening. The neon sign was beckoning me to enter, but the chairs had already been stacked against the front windows and it looked like they were doing the ohgodit'sslowpleasecanwegohome prolonged breakdown, so Mr. Man went and peeked his head in to inquire if they were still able to do a take out order. Oh yeah, it was smoked meat time. \n\nThe menu had all sorts of delicious sounding sandwiches and the barbeque staples, and most of it was heavy on the meat, so keep the veg heads away from this butcher shop or they'll be forced to nibble on the sides. The server couldn't have been more personal and engaging as we chatted about the menu offerings and details about the new place. After listening to her recommendations I ended up going with the pulled pork sandwich with beans for $7.95, while Mr. Man got the half rack of ribs with beans and fries. \n\nShe was chatting up a storm with us about how good the food was and even gave us a sample of their special of the day, Sloppy Joes, which was bangin'! I had no idea sloppy joes could possibly shake their Manwich stigma, but the meat was tender and spiced just right and I can't even explain it. It was off the hook good and it was a fucking spoonful of sloppy joes. I still can't wrap my head around it. \n\nOnce our orders were up we trotted home and dug into massive amounts of mouthwatering good barbeque. The sauce wasn't overly vinegary or tomatoey or sweet, and all the flavors complemented one another and lovingly embraced my porky goodness. Three huge sliders were included in my order, the buns were soft as marshmallow fluff and the beans, oh, the beans! Crispy little strips of bacon high fived my beanie little friends to double team the flavor factor. The ribs were HUGE and were definitely the stand out entree ordered. They were smoked on the premises, nicely charred and melt off the bone tender. The dogs agree with me, even though they just got the bones. Beware the french fries. They're limp since they're freshly cut and fried. But they were smothered in fresh garlic, so I found a way to overlook that little deterrent. \n\nThey also have a ton of drink specials, from the tried and true bottle of domestic brew to funky flavored sangrias. And although I didn't try it, their dessert is a haystack cookie made of pretzel sticks, mini marshmallows, peanut butter and butterscotch sauce and they sound like something I would have made when I was too young to use the stove so I was dependent on the microwave for making chex mix and shit on a shingle. (I had a Jell-o cook book as a kiddo and tried just about every recipe in there, including the nasty mixed vegetables suspended in unflavored gelatin and beef stock. Weird.) They're also in the process of creating a patio out front where you can enjoy a picnic like atmosphere with the food to complement it. \n\nSo I guess I have to revise my opening statement. I'm a recovering barbeque-phobe, and this cheap as sin, make me groan with pleasure barbeque joint will definitely be worked into the regular rotation.\n\nSince I haven't eaten there more than once, I'm giving it four stars, but if it continues to be this awesome, it'll be a five star joint for me!","useful":5,"funny":6,"cool":4}

Let's think back to the dusty basement\/garage\/rec room that you and all your buddies used to hang out in during high school. If you had friends with money there were ping pong tables, air hockey, pool tables or video games. Of if your friends were more like mine, a TV with rabbit ears.

Hard. You might pull back something a little stumpy. That was the most delectable little nibblet on the plate. The fish was super flaky and buttery, although the sauce was forgettable.

Our waiter was well informed and personable, although he disappeared half way through the meal, was replaced and we never saw him again, which was kinda weird. \n\nThe customers he was serving were pretty inconsiderate. There was a huge party of people with kids rip roaring around the restaurant off in the side room.

I don't go out to listen to the rip roar of impatient ankle biters. Instant plus two for the atmosphere as soon as they left.\n\nBut then a large group of older patrons came in and bitched about how they couldn't read the menus because it was too dark, so they turned up the lights, bent the atmosphere over the side of a chair and fucked it hard.\n\nSo I think I'm going to be a downer on the super streak Medizona's having and only give it a four.

So important it deserves both capitalization and idolization.\n\nDistilled from the finest aquatic varieties and banned in all fifty states, its pale gold, opaque frothiness will lull you into a happy state of drunkenness and sociability.

End of vet visit we're presented with a bill for 40 some odd bucks.\n\nAfter some pretty heavy complaining that, \"WTF, mate? That's not what you said on the phone,\" they waived the initial visitation fee and let us go on our merry way. I've cross checked the prices here with other vets to get the little booger vaccinated and sure enough, they charged for the vet visit in addition to the vaccination fees. \n\nGo to Blue Cross Animal Clinic down the street and they'll charge you the flat fee for the vaccine, no office visit or nothin'. Sure beats the crappy clinic at Petsmart too, where they charge the same straight fee for the vaccines and waive the vet visit. \n\nI do like that I'm still on their mailing list though, and get my yearly check-up reminder for my little pupperoni.","useful":8,"funny":1,"cool":1}

Go order a Dagwood from Gandolfo's deli. It's roast beef, turkey, ham, pastrami, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, mayo, spicy mustard, salt and pepper, as close to nirvana as I'm ever getting. (In case you couldn't tell by the ingredients, I was a little indecisive about what kind of sandwich I wanted, so I just took the works.)\n\nDuring lunch it can get a little hairy in Gandolfo's deli, and I'm not talking about the number of people there (which is many) but the ratio of males to females (which is very high, me being the only customer lacking a y chromosome). There is a reason why this is so. These sandwiches are monstrous meat and cheese concoctions slathered in sauce and served big. I could easily make a phallic reference about all these men consuming massive hoagies, but I'm going to take the high road this review.\n\nI was considering the hard salami smothered in sauce, but I didn't know if it would be filling enough...\n\nOkay. So the low road suits me better. \n\nI opted for the $2.49 meal deal to complement my Dagwood, which left me with a gigantic sandwich, a quarter pound of potato salad, and a regular iced tea with plenty left over for dinner that night. It was close to ten bucks after tax, which is a little bit on the pricey side, but at least I made two meals of it. \n\nThe potato salad was decent but lacked salt, like they didn't bother boiling the potatoes with this necessary ingredient. I love me some salt. Get me a lick and I'll take a cheese grater to it to season my meals. Or make me a salt flavored ring pop for those mid day cravings. My blood pressure will curse you, but I'll be singing your praises. After adding this magic ingredient Gandolfo's potato salad got pretty good, and they get extra credit for using red potatoes, leaving the skin on, and preparing it with vinaigrette and mayo instead of mustard. Yum!\n\nIt's pretty decent for a sandwich shop and the menu is intimidating in size and offerings. You could do much worse *coughBlimpie'scough*, so give it a whirl if you find yourself in the area.","useful":9,"funny":9,"cool":4}

Yeah, neither do I, but I've been told from the horse's mouth (sorry to call you a horse, Mr. Man) that it used to be a hip and happening place with plenty of small, custom shops and dives instead of the now ubiquitous mega-corporate whorebaggery. Luckily, you have only to travel a little bit further west on University to steep yourself in that old school neighborhood feel. \n\nThai Basil gets big stars for being one of these homey neighborhood joints. Along with El Pollo, Tops, Tempe Bicycle, HTC, Otto's, Headquarters, Buffalo, etc., this locally owned restaurant has consistently provided inviting ambiance, wonderful service and delicious food for pennies compared to anything on Mill.\n\nI just finished my leftover red curry chicken just before I wrote this, and it was every bit as savory and rich as it was last night (just make sure to put the leftover sticky rice in a plastic bag or it'll get crusty). The fragrance and flavor of all their curries (red, green, yellow, and peanut) is if not unmatched, pretty damn close to the best offered at any Thai place I've dined. Thick, al dente, crinkle cut carrots, bamboo shoots, green beans, broccoli, zucchini, red and green peppers with tender choice of meat afloat in savory coconut milk that suspends the perfect amount of earthy spice and hot chili to ensure that the meal dances on your taste buds.\n\nMy favorite dishes aside, just about everything on the menu at Thai Basil has proved to be exemplary. The Thai Basil is their signature dish and certainly doesn't skimp on its namesake fresh basil and thick flavorful sauce. The Pad Thai is sure as hell better than what's offered at Bamboo Club, with ample crushed peanuts and noodles that don't turn into a puddle of goo once the dish cools. The Garlic Pork has a lighter sauce that still manages all the fragrance and flavor of its more syrupy counterparts. The papaya salad is crisp, citric, sweet and spicy, an excellent accompaniment to a rich meal. Or try the crispy spring rolls that manage to be filling despite their humble size. The chicken satay with peanut sauce is also a very good choice for picky eaters (or kiddos), although they'll truly miss out on the more complex flavors of this amazing food. \n\nThai Basil is a fairly small restaurant with dark wood tables that are all very closely spaced to ensure the maximum number of people can be seated. There is booth seating along the back and stretching the length of one side, while high tables and chairs are located in the windowed area facing Farmer. The decorations are sparse but complement the overall Asian feel, with bamboo accessories, knick knacks and family pictures decorating the walls. The richly colored, metallic embroidered skirt\/pants worn by the waitresses are also for sale if you're looking for something special to spice up your wardrobe.\n\nDespite its small size, I've never experienced the long wait times that others have when I come here. The servers have always been very attentive and quick to refill a glass or take my order, and are honest with their opinion when asked what they enjoy on the menu. I don't generally go here on busy nights though, and the hours I attend are either early or late evening, so maybe I avoid the hectic rush, because the kitchen is pretty small. At least you know you're getting fresh Thai from the folks who know it best as a result. If you don't have a lot of time to wait and just want a quick dinner, it's also possible to phone in your order or walk in, order, visit the shops around the restaurant and return in ten minutes to a piping hot order.\n\nTry out the lunch specials! They're a great deal and they get you in and out within the hour. Although this is the one time of the day I've been when it's a bit on the slow side, since the entire restaurant is always packed. But the crowd is oddly well staggered since I've never seen anyone waiting for a table. For about eight bucks you get a small salad with tangy sweet vinaigrette, a spring roll with sweet and sour sauce, and your choice of dish with a ball of rice on the side. It's usually enough so I have one extra lunch leftover, compared to the two lunches I usually have with the regular dinner dishes. \n\nOne thing I've noticed over time is that their \"hot\" really isn't that hot, so if you like it spicy, make sure to specify. \n\nThai Basil is a comfortable neighborhood restaurant that attracts the type of customers Mill Avenue only wishes it could, loyal ones. As Mill whores itself out to the highest corporate bidder, I envision the property owners diving through coins like Scrooge McDuck and doing their best impression of Mr. Burns'. But the obscene retail rent checks signed reflects the boost in product price and the blandness of corporate hegemony. It's a relief for this starving-but-no-longer-student to support a local eatery by driving just a little west of that circus.","useful":9,"funny":5,"cool":8}

Best happy hour anywhere in the valley! \n\nChallenge: If you can find a better happy hour than the three dollar bonanza at Cafe Zuzu, I will eat one of the wretched pickled eggs from Palo Verde Lounge, the gray-green eggs that time forgot.\n\nI'll start with the tapas-style appetizers because they really blew me away. Two fall-of-the-bone tender braised pork shanks that will melt in your mouth and fill your belly? Three bucks. A surprisingly ample mini prime rib dip with (unassuming) horseradish mayo and au jus? Three bucks. Two buttery, rich grilled brie and thin sliced green apple sandwiches with fig jam reduction? Three bucks. I'm salivating right now. \n\nThe other two options included the border chili, which had fresh chunks of meat but was a bit bland compared to the rest of the apps, and the bruschetta that was utterly forgettable. Standard tomatoes, olives and capers, nowhere near as memorable as Il Postino or La Bocca's stellar examples. \n\nSince these apps are a bit on the small side, the best bang for your buck to sate your hunger would be the mini pork shanks, followed closely by the prime rib dip. The artisan grilled cheese was my personal favorite (sooo perfectly buttery, sweet and savory!), but it really would have benefited from another little grilled brie sammich on the plate because they're quite small. \n\nSeveral of our party tried the wine (chard, pinot, merlot, and I think they've even got some bubbly) and had positive things to say. While we all had zero interest in trying the beer, since it was just PBR on draft or domestic swill in bottles. There were much better options to be had for three bucks, like the specialty cocktails! \n\nThe waitress that took care of us was kind enough to explain what each of the cocktails entailed. Best liquor bang for your buck? The Hot 'N' Dirty, an extra dirty vodka martini with a splash of Tabasco and three olives. They even bring it out in a little cocktail shaker to pour tableside, ensuring that not a drop of goodness is wasted on the way to your table. Second most potent potable was the Bourbon Smash, a whiskey cocktail that's the illegitimate love child of a mojito and a mint julep. In the words of Sammy J, \"It'll getcha drunk!\" \n\nThe Gin Fizz was one of the most refreshing cocktails, kind of a gin and tonic with more prominent citrus notes and a splash of simple syrup. And for the girlie girls in attendance, the Bramble, Basil Showbiz and Cherry Limeade will treat ya right! The Bramble was heavy on the blackberry, the Basil Showbiz strawberried out and the Cherry Limeade had me second guessing whether someone had spiked a Sonic limeade. Superb, one and all. I haven't a single bad word to say about any the cocktails taste-wise, although the more frou frou drinks seemed a bit light on the pour. \n\nThree dollar beer, wine, specialty cocktails and appetizers? A frenzy of (relatively sophisticated) gluttony? A mere 15 bucks. Cafe Zuzu is my new go-to for happy hour!","useful":15,"funny":10,"cool":16}

Eww! *scrunchy nose*\n\nDo shriveled potato skins, overcooked fried zucchini sticks, or soggy hot wings float your boat? Eww. *disdainful sneer*\n\nDoes the fact that they constantly change their specials and scheduled events without notice, luring you into this depressing hole under false pretenses sound dandy? Eww... *depressed sigh*\n\nI live dangerously close to this place, so more often than not I'll end up here when there's a dispute along the veins of: \"Whatta you wanna do tonight? I dunno. How bout you?\"\n\nMost frequently this is the end decision on a Friday night, when they hold live trivia with a host and the opportunity to win 20 to 30 bucks if you come in first or second place. But it's difficult to enjoy some live trivia when it's canceled every other week without any prior notice. That kind of business ethic doesn't instill any loyalty in your customer base. It's also kind of trashy how our winning credits are always hand written in near illegible chicken scratch on a piece of register tape, only redeemable for food, and only on a day other than trivia time. I get it. You want to lure us back on a weekday so we'll spend money in the bar. Klassy.\n\nI wouldn't have such a problem with the place if it the food was at least worth it. The nachos are huge and covered in lots of toppings but it's primarily cheap-o nacho cheese sauce or sour cream, which add little flavor and just make the whole thing a sloppy mess. The wings are soggy and generic (the hot isn't spicy in the least-- maybe they were referring to the temperature?), and there's an absolutely terrible Island Jerk flavor. The zucchini sticks are always overcooked and soggy. The cheese sticks are hard and chewy, not stringy mozzarella. The potato skins look like shriveled little potato abortions adorned by three bacon bits and some nacho sauce. The pizza is pretty decent and probably your best bet. I wouldn't recommend anything else on the menu. They use cheap, bargain basement product and it shows in the quality of the food.\n\nThat leaves the bar to make up for the abysmal food. Too bad that's pretty hit or miss, with an emphasis on the miss. For about a two month stretch Sneakers seemed to change their daily specials week by week if not day by day. One day it would be two dollar ladies mixed drinks all day, next week just 9pm to close. Then it would be two dollar drafts all day, changed to half priced wings during happy hour. I don't like the bait and switch. I understand that a new or struggling place needs to cut costs and redefine its specials but when it's changing that often (too quickly for even the signage on the tables or menus to keep up) there's a serious issue with management that needs to be addressed. \n\nIt seems like they've finally settled things to 75 cent domestic draft beers during happy hour (Coors and Bud) and half priced appetizers. Solid. Then from 9pm to close the daily drink specials start. Good. Keep it simple, stupid.\n\nThe service at least tries to make up for the crappy food and ever changing drink specials. They're always more than patient when it comes to explaining the changes and always apologetic when they get the brunt of our disappointment when we've been victims of the ole bait and switch. \n\nThe decor looks like a tacky college sports fan decorated it with all the tables sporting different teams and mascots, and paraphernalia splashed all over the walls willy nilly. There's also a weird identity problem going on, with some cheap wine prints on display in the bar and a gigantic statue of Uncle Lester from the Addams Family dressed in a referee suit. They offer Rock Band but I've never seen anyone playing it. They offer the Buzztime Trivia but hardly any televisions are ever tuned to it. There's a couple pool tables, darts, a basketball game, Buck Hunter and a couple other video games in the back. It just seems to be having an extreme identity crisis, trying to be something different to everyone, but half assing it so no one ends up satisfied.\n\nThey've taken to serving beer in plastic cups and giving out paper plates for food during happy hour which is a bit on the depressing side. The general vibe makes it seem like it's on the brink of closing any given week, which is too bad because they easily have one of the best patios in Tempe. \n\nIf you're going to go, sit on the patio and enjoy the greenery, cool water, friendly ducks and turtles sunning themselves. It will make you forget just how much of a downer it is inside the place.","useful":10,"funny":10,"cool":8}

So order dressing on the side if you're a featherweight like me. At times some items have been a bit stale as well. I've had some unfortunate puff pastry that seemed like it had been freezer burned or microwaved a hair too long.

To avoid compromising the values of my veggie friends by forcing them to make me man meat, it's always best to choose a place with plenty of greens on the menu. Pita Jungle is the perfect harmony between flesh renders and herbivores. And it doesn't just have the \"hold the chicken\" type vegg friendly option on the menu, it's got lentils and shit.\n\nNow, since we've already established that I live under rocks, you can just go ahead and assume I've never been to Pita Jungle. What can I say, the grub hunting was good. But after my first visit you can bet your skinny little vegan ass I'll be noshing right next to you on a regular basis. \n\nThe restaurant has apparently expanded twice since it's been open and it was still hoppin' last night, with an open, airy feel and interesting artwork decorating the walls. We hovered over the seating section booth thingy and were told to go ahead and steal any open seat we liked. Some may find this annoying and unorganized, but I really like it when they let me do that part of their job for them, so we snagged a table for two right next to the window so I could watch some dog TV, which was showing a tig old biddy sorority girl special based on the number of perky young freshman coming and going in the parking lot. (Side note: Big old windows are like big screen dog TVs because dogs don't watch human TV, they keep track of the cats trotting through their territory and bark at the mailman and monitor the comings and goings of the neighborhood through windows. At least in my experience. I'll be sitting there glued to the tube and the dogs will be sitting there glued to the window. End tangent. Thanks for your patience.)\n\nOthers have complained about the poor service at this location, but surprise (sarcasm) Mr. Man ends up knowing the waiter assigned to our section, so we were promptly rewarded with menus and drinks. Not that I would have even noticed the wait since I was agape, trying to take in everything offered on a menu that just wouldn't quit. Eventually I grabbed hold of my indecision and narrowed it down to three options, the black bean burger, the lavosh shawarma wrap, or the Caribbean salad. We agreed that not having hummus simply wasn't an option so I went with the shawarma so I could pep it up with some left over hummus, and I really dig lavosh because it reminds me of saltines, which I don't really like that much, but are scrumptious in flatbread form. Mr. Man decided upon the grilled vegetable salad, because if you've ever met him, he really needs to watch his boyish figure (again, sarcasm).\n\nWe ordered an extra pita for the hummus, which was overkill and we didn't even end up touching it because the \"small hummus\" ended up being freakin' huge and the pita was sized to match. It was smooth and creamy, and garnished with two of my favorite vegetables (or whatever an olive technically is), cucumbers and kalamata olives! My one gripe about the entire meal was that my chicken was overly dry and a smidgen bland, but the hummus more than made up for that lack in flavor. The side Greek salad that came with my wrap was also stupendous, with a hefty amount of feta and a delicious, light vinaigrette to counter that richness. Mr. Man's grilled vegetable salad was also very well done, with crisp veggies, lots of garlic and an awesome dressing. \n\nAnd this delish bounty of fresh, healthy food came to 20 bucks between the two of us and left us with enough leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

There were no belly dancers or tarot card readers, both dinner time lures advertised upon entering, since the noon-to-one crowd is generally geared toward the white collar crowd. That eliminated the possibility of a razzle dazzle performance that may have lured another star out of me, leaving the service, ambiance and food to shine on their own.\n\nThe service was adequate. Not really much to say either way on that. I did kind of like the fact that the wait staff was all eating there in a family setting and were just finishing up when I arrived. That immediately raised my expectations, since they wouldn't settle for anything nasty. Also, the kitchen was filled with....Turks! Not a single word of Spanish, which is quite an anomaly in the food service business. Again, my expectations raised.\n\nUpon entering, the customer is given the option of sitting at regular or low seating. I highly recommend the latter, as it consists of plush pillows and short stools arranged around round tables. The main dining area is very open air with warm colors and sparse decorations, but it feels more sterile than the environment created in the adjacent rooms. Within these rooms comfortable open booths and pillows, upholstered in dark, rich colors are accented by decorative lighting that could have been bought from a bazaar and transported straight here.

The lamb that I ordered was a little on the bland side and stringy. It would have done much better stewed than grilled. I would also highly recommend you trade the plain ole white rice for the biriani rice, which is saffron (turmeric?) based with veggie bits and walnuts. It was savory and scrumptious, the exact opposite of the cabbage slaw, which was an odd combination of vinegar, mint and garlic. It was a little pricey for a lunch special, ringing in at $10.95 without beverages, and the dinner specials are even more expensive.\n\nI would come here a second time for the atmosphere, and maybe for the belly dancing, but I would definitely try something else off the menu.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

It is unlikely any of you will find yourself here in the near future and hopefully not even in the far future, as this is where vitality goes to die. But if you find yourself with a flat tire out in the middle of BFE or need to take Grandma out for a night on the town (bedtime by 8pm at the latest, sonny!), this is a pretty respectable choice. And in full confidentiality, it managed to surprise me.\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nI can't fathom why, but my family resides in the suburban sprawl of Peoria, which happens to border Sun City. I haven't been out to this haven for golf carts and cataracts since I used to live way out in northwest Glendale, but for my stepmother's birthday she wanted to eat at Little Bite of Italy. So we pile in to the car for the mini road trip out there from Tempe.\n\nHaving arrived early, Mr. Man and I saunter up to the bar and (gasp!) get carded. Seeing how we were mere babes in the womb compared to some of the patrons there, this was no big surprise. What was surprising was the house sauvignon blanc I ordered that tasted like sweet tarts. And cost a whopping $6.50 for a bitsy little glass. Whatevs. Old people's livers don't work as well as mine, so I can see how they can get away with upping the price.\n\nI was also surprised at this freaky gigantic beer tap that was ordered for the table. It seemed like a little bit of frat boy flava delivered to a demographic that could be their parents or grandparents. It was a wicked cool cylindrical device that held three pitchers and had a chilled center at the base. A gigantic bong of of booze if you will.\n\nSince I'm indecisive I went with the sampler: meat lasagna, chicken parmesan and fettuccine alfredo. Aside from the fact that it needed salt (again, my blood pressure probably isn't as high as the older folks), the meal was pretty tasty. The alfredo was lackluster, but I've rarely had good alfredo from a restaurant so it was no surprise. I also grazed on a piece of The Works pizza with sausage, pepperoni, onions, mushroom, red and green peppers. That was far superior and the left over pizza reheated to a lovely crisp in the oven the next day.\n\nThe entertainment was probably the highlight of the evening. There was a 50+ (don't want to offend by guessing wrong), petite female performer in what could have doubled as a figure skating outfit singing her little heart out on stage. She had a great voice, oozed mature sex appeal all over the male customers (no need for viagra that night) and took requests like the pro she was. All ages were shakin' what their momma gave them up in front of the stage, me included, and it was a surprising amount of fun.\n\nI never knew Sun City could be so spry! Respect.","useful":5,"funny":8,"cool":3}

Because it's more like that neglected house down the street owned by the Cat Lady that has chipped paint and an overgrown yard, but when you stop there on Halloween she always has those awesome popcorn balls. Or that ottoman that's a little frayed around the edges and is patched with duct tape to keep the upholstery skirt on, but it's the comfiest damn foot rest. \n\nDespite the looks, the bar is a local watering hole that attracts your quirky neighbors. Someone brought in the pelt of a javelina they'd shot the day prior to show it off to his buddies. Ever seen one of those ugly things up close? You just might get the chance if you decide to check it out. Chuy's two doors down will serve as a neon-lit mecca for mass consumption, while Baseline Pub will remain the watering hole in the wall that's a little more mellow and a little rougher around the edges.\n\nHappy hour is twelve hours long, from ten to ten, so they don't really have any drink specials, but the prices are cheap so that's not really an issue. Plus there's the requisite pool tables that every good dive has, so you've got something to occupy your time in addition to conversation with the locals.\n\nThe down side is that the mixed drinks are a bit on the weak side, so stick with beer. The music selection kind of sucks at times, with either country western or classic rock playing. (Cross your fingers for the classic rock.) The waitresses are pretty inattentive as well, so make sure there aren't any lapses in conversation, because silence sure drags long without something to quench your thirst.","useful":5,"funny":4,"cool":2}

And those are just the flavors I've sampled.

From a business perspective it makes perfect sense. People get thirsty when shopping, especially in the desert, and this place appears like an oasis on the horizon. If it was a dinky little independent establishment it would never receive the exposure that it does at Tempe Marketplace and probably would have a hard time staying solvent, regardless of how much we adoring Yelpers build it up. So I'd rather laud the smarts of a business man who broke through the corporate mold and managed to offer an independent and hip lil tea shop amid the brand name wasteland that is Tempe Marketplace than complain about it. \n\nIt's so nice to step into this place, breath a sigh of relief and shake off the oppressive crowd of consumers (and anklebiters) waiting just outside that door, especially if it's a weekend evening. And I've got to say that a nice cuppa makes the window shopping, caterwauling live band, and gaggles of giggling adolescents much more enjoyable.\n\nAside from a tea selection that puts China Mist to shame, they offer some munchitos that I've never indulged in like sandwiches, sides and scrumptious looking desserts. One day, Tea Infusion, one day.\n\nThe only complaint I have is with the staff. \n\nI understand you don't make much and sometimes customers are devilish. I've been a barista before. But that's no excuse to neglect your customers or the cleanliness of your establishment. I went on a Saturday night and one chick was very loudly and obnoxiously chatting up a customer, leaving her coworker to fall behind when handling group after group of people by his lonesome. The counter was filthy and cluttered with tea paraphernalia, smoothie stuff, dirty steeping devices, and milk that someone had neglected to put back in the refrigerator. I wanted to jump behind the counter, tidy up that terrible mess and help a dude out, then give that flirty flit at the end of the counter a piece of my mind. \n\nI get the disenfranchisement you feel when being paid slightly over minimum wage, but have a little respect for customer service and the integrity of your shop or you won't have one to report to for long.","useful":16,"funny":8,"cool":8}

Can ambiance and service compensate for sub par food at ridiculous prices? Oh, the dilemma! I like the beautiful decor and attentive service, but I also like reasonably priced entrees with discernable flavor. Let's see...nope. Well that didn't take very long to decide.\n\nI've eaten at this location several times. The last time was with a very large group of people, and I got to try many different things off the menu. It basically boiled down to two flavor categories: spicy or non-spicy. The spicy dishes tasted like they had been prepared in one stock sauce. The non-spicy dishes tasted like they had been prepared in a similar sauce that omitted the chili oil. Here and there they added other things, like black bean paste or some sweetness, but most of the dishes tasted pretty much the same. I suppose this is why the menu doesn't go into detail when describing the difference between entrees, just listing \"Mongolian Chicken\" or \"BC Hot and Spicy Chicken,\" since just the veggies and protein are interchangeable and no really strong flavor characterizes any one dish. \n\nWe started off with the appetizer sampler: Sesame Honey Chicken, BC Egg Rolls, Coconut Shrimp, and Pot Stickers. Everything was perfectly adequate and worth the price since it served 4 people. The chicken was crispy, sweet and sprinkled with sesame seeds. The egg rolls tasted like they had been fried in old oil, but I fixed that by dousing it in hot mustard. The coconut shrimp were thin, crunchy, and not too sweet. The pot stickers were steamed with a delicious pork filling, probably the best thing on the tray. It was all pretty good filler before the meal. But it's kind of a sad affair when the appetizers trump the actual main course...\n\nEverything came out really fast for a group of nine people and was piping hot. We shared it family style and here's the details, from best entree to worst:\n*Cantonese Noodles- Wicked fricken good! If I end up going again, I'm definitely ordering this dish. Shrimp, scallops, BBQ pork, chicken and Asian vegetables with wheat noodles tossed in a light but flavorful sauce.\n*Grilled Halibut- Well cooked and flaky. Mango and pineapple salsa was decent and the presentation was very well done.\n*Chicken with Asparagus- I was barely able to distinguish the black bean sauce it was supposedly cooked in, but the chicken was tender and the asparagus al dente. \n*BC Spicy Chicken- This falls under the 'spicy' category of food flavoring. It was a little spicy, a little sweet, and very generic. Supposedly their equivalent of 'Kung Pao,' but it tasted...weirder than any other Kung Pao I've had. \n*Mandarin Orange Scallops- Tough and overcooked, same flavors as the BC Spicy Chicken but with more sugar and no kick. The crispy spinach was interesting though.\n*Bamboo Bejing Duck- It was overcooked and dry rather than being crispy. The Asian pancakes were also dry, but the accompanying plum sauce lubricated things well enough. \n*Pad Thai Rice Noodles- Turned into a sticky noodle block after the first couple minutes. I've made the equivalent from a box in the 'Asian foods' aisle at Fry's. \n*Thai Curry Chicken and Shrimp- The Bamboo Club needs to focus on their Chinese offerings instead of their piss poor Thai dishes. Not good by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nThe side dishes were, like the appetizers, respectable but not amazing. The Dynasty Fried Rice tasted a lot like any other fried rice you'd order. No surprise or disappointment there. The Woked Mushrooms were very well cooked in a light sauce. Much better than most of the entrees even though it was a side dish. The Woked Asparagus had the same flavor as the mushrooms, both of which tasted suspiciously similar to the Chicken with Asparagus. Perhaps it just lacked the dollop of black bean paste?\n\nSo if you go, go for the ambiance. The patio is nice for Mill Avenue people watching and secluded enough to enjoy your meal with a little privacy. The service is attentive and quick to refill any glass or comply with your requests, even for a large group of people. At the very least these guys deserve the high tips generated by pricy entrees. It's too bad the food is so damn generic. Definitely not worth the 13-25 dollar price tag per entree. \n\nMaybe happy hour is the best option for attending this place? Cheap three dollar appetizers and drink specials without the unnecessary disappointment of crappy food? Maybe I'll give it a whirl in the future.\n\nIf you're wrangled into dinner there, go with the Cantonese noodles, crispy spinach and woked veggies. Best stuff on the menu. Or risk it and order something else. Maybe I went on an off night...but I doubt it since this is a corporate chain the same the country over.","useful":5,"funny":4,"cool":4}

And at this new location they've created a sleek, urban eatery that fits right in with the rest of the locations on Mill Avenue, but manages to trump them in every respect. (Price, service, ambiance, and of course, the FOOD.)\n\nDragonfly just opened a week ago and has a large banner instead of a sign advertising their presence, but judging by the lunch time crowd, word of mouth has really worked for this place. Their lunch time specials are impressive, with offerings of papaya salad, spring bowls, rice plates, several types of pho and Vietnamese sandwiches with soup or ginger vinaigrette dressed greens as a side for a humble...wait for it...$7.50. I'm still baffled at how they can offer such plentiful, healthy, delicious food at such a reasonable price.\n\nThe soup of the day was Dungeness crab and asparagus soup, and there was no way I was passing up crab soup for a measly salad. It was such a good decision to go with double soup (pho and soup du jour) because it was peppered broth with HUGE chunks of real crab, asparagus, mushrooms and baby corn that was out of this world! We ordered the spring rolls as well, which were also HUGE with poached pork and shrimp, vermicelli noodles, mint, lettuce, bean sprouts, and cucumbers wrapped in rice paper and served with some of the best spicy peanut sauce I have ever had. The soup and spring rolls would have made a perfectly adequate lunch, but once the pho arrived, I dropped everything for this brothy delight.\n\nIt was served in a HUGE (picking up on the trend here?) square bowl with thin slivered beef, vermicelli, and scallions and garnished with bean sprouts, lime wedges, fresh mint, jalapenos, sriracha chili sauce, hoisin sauce and soy sauce. Any combination of these additional ingredients will result in a savory concoction that can help you nurse a cold or open your sinuses, all while warming you to the core. It's fresh, healthy, light and scrumptious! I can see myself eating her very, very often in the future, and straying from my usual order of pho to branch out and try other things on their menu, all of which are still reasonably priced for a Mill Avenue joint (FUCKING SUCK IT BOA!) at 8 to 12 bucks an entree. I would also highly recommend the fresh squeezed limeade, made with sparkling seltzer water instead of still, which was a refreshing spritz of flavor. They also have a full bar, a must for Mill Avenue joint.\n\nThe outdoor patio is surrounded by a pretty twisted wrought iron canopy exit at the front of the store and will offer a lovely dining experience since the weather has started to cool down. Inside the restaurant, the color scheme (green, white, plum and black) and ambiance create a fresh, vibrant, urban feel with large bamboo fixtures nested in beds of smooth black rocks. After talking to our server we were also informed that they hope to have a mellow live musical act in the middle of the restaurant in the near future for diners to enjoy. \n\nThe service was also AMAZING! Prompt, friendly, easy on the eyes, and attentive. The food was ready lightening fast (almost too quickly considering our first courses, but I can see how the speed is great for getting people on a lunch break in and out) and the waiter was charming, making sure we got everything we could possibly need at lightening speed. \n\nI really, really, REALLY hope this place does well because I want to become a regular here. So go check it out and support a local business rather than a shitty chain on Mill Avenue. I can only hope more of these gems continue to pepper this ever increasing stretch of vapid consumerism, so I don't end up feeling like a corporate whore after my meal. Don't want to taint a dining experience this good with whoredom.\n\n*****UPDATE*****\nThey have happy hour specials now from 3pm to 7pm! Half price appetizers: Tamarind chicken wings, lettuce wraps, crispy shrimp wontons, hoisin glazed spare ribs, and Vietnamese salt 'n pepper calamari! Domestic bottles 2 bucks, Imports for only a buck more, top shelf well drinks for 5 bucks, and house wine for 3 bucks.\n\nThursday through Saturday they have live jazz on the patio from 7pm to 10pm. Best thing of all? They extend their happy hour appetizer and drink specials to their customers during this time. So you could eat and drink cheaply anytime between 3pm and 10pm Thursday and Friday! AWESOME!","useful":5,"funny":3,"cool":4}

I think it had more to do with the fact that spaghetti given to a kiddo is more likely to end up on them than in them, and tomato sauce hurts when it ends up in your eye. But in twenty-odd years my palate has matured past the realm of bland noodles and into the realm of big girl flavors. I think that's why I was so disappointed by Giuseppe's. \n\nI ordered the smoked salmon with asparagus pasta, thinking, \"Heck yeah, lox me up and throw away the key!\" Instead, I got the toddler special in disguise, a big pile of noodles drowning in butter, with flakes of salmon and asparagus floating throughout. Ewwie. The noodles were freshly prepared since it was the weekend and were a doughy delight. It's too bad they were marred by such a crap combination. I mean, you can't even toss in some garlic, onions or something vaguely resembling seasoning? Failure, failure, failure.\n\nMy boyfriend's pasta carbonara was a thing of beauty. It is very difficult to find real carbonara in the valley. Most places just toss together white sauce and bacon and call it a night. Very few take the time to saute onions, garlic and pancetta, add steaming hot pasta, raw egg and parmesan cheese and toss until it oozes together into drool inducing blob of yum. Amazing good. \n\nIt's just odd that such contradictory dishes are on the same menu. \n\nWe also had the garlic bread, because what better to add to a giant pile of carbs than more bread? It was passable. Very dry and crispy, more like crouton, and topped with a delish garlicky spice infused oil. Four tiny toastettes for four bucks though. Not the greatest deal. \n\nI shall be back.

It's all about perspective.\n\nI happen to like the gooey little pearls that collect at the bottom of milky green tea, and Eba Cafe is the best place in the valley to indulge. They used to be located just north of ASU and I would pop in before classes, until one day they vanished without a trace.

Jelly goodness afloat in milky green or black tea with one of thirty-some possible flavors added!\n \nThe black and green tea are traditional stand-bys, but if you're feeling daring, try the wintermelon tea. It has no sugar added but the natural sugar is so incredibly potent that I couldn't finish a thimble full sample without experiencing the puckered, day-uuum-that's-sweet face. After you've chosen your tea, try to narrow down the flavor additives, red bean is a solid choice but watermelon is my ultimate trump card. Mango, taro and honeydew are also pretty tasty. Then decide if you want some kind of gelatinous goop added to your drink. They have several different types including boba and coffee jellies, which I've heard are great in, well, coffee drinks.\n\nEba also has some light lunch and munch options if you feel like nibbling. I've had the green curry chicken bowl, which is earthy with a nice spice, but the accompanying rice was a little dried out. If you're just there for a snack, try the brick toast with coconut. Delish!

Greg would string me up by my toenails and make me repent for my burger sins if he knew I was reviewing his favorite place as just a three star burger joint. But I can't abide paying ten to twelve bucks for a fast food burger, fries and a drink. That's crazy cakes. \n\nGranted the burger is juicy perfection, grilled to order with as many custom toppings as your hardening arteries can handle. They have two in particular that get me salivating every time: grilled mushrooms and onions. That alone should warrant a fourth star, especially since they don't cost an extra couple bucks a pop like most places. But it's still a six freakin' dollar burger. If they hadn't plastered their walls with newspaper reviews exalting how cheap their eats were, I would probably be a bit more accommodating, but more than ten bucks for a fast foodie burger meal just ain't on.\n\nI do also like that they offer a mini version of their two patty big madre burger, for the wimps like me out there. Regardless, I would recommend keeping the foil around your burger and peeling it away like the burritos from Chipoodle. This will guarantee that all those slippery little grilled mushroom and onion tidbits stay in place, because they're seriously too good to get away. \n\nThe french fries are also in the style that I like, freshly fried up with the bejeezus salted out of them. Ten billion times better than the fresh but somehow still super bland and lifeless matchsticks that In & Out serves. The Cajun style fries are just sprinkled with seasoned salt. A bit of a let down from what I was expecting but a nice change in pace since it's usually curly fries that get the seasoned salt treatment. Also if you're a limey barstard like me you can grab a bottle of malt vinegar from the side counter and use it to drown your fries. So good.\n\nI also dig on the free peanuts. I realize this is a polarizing issue considering the risk of nut allergies out there, but I like it. When I was a kid I used to judge the caliber of an establishment by whether or not I could throw peanut shells on the ground. Sadly, that has changed very little with the years because I still get a kick out of doing it. \n\nAlright. I've talked myself into it. It's getting an extra star.

The little parking lot in a strip mall off Apache was bustling with activity, so I hoped we would be able to score a table easier than we had tried for a parking spot. I don't like waiting for the first meal of the day. I turn into the reckapotamus from Hell, whose disposition is a combination between that of a pissed off hippopotamus and an icy cold imp from the underworld. \n\nBut there wasn't a soul to be found enjoying a Tasty Kabob...it was a strange Twilight Zone of inactivity. Everyone and their mother was next door at Pita Jungle, but just because there are a lot of people there doesn't mean it's any good, just that they prefer to flock toward mediocrity, like sheep, or lemmings.\n\nHalfway through the meal, I was thinking about flocking too. \n\nAlthough the hummus came with olives, chopped tomatoes and herbs, it was a bit bland overall. The pitas were warm and delicious though, and the combination of hummus and flat bread helped keep the reckapotamus banished to the depths. It was a generous portion for two, but I found myself munching on it just to pass the time until our lunches came, not because it was exceptionally well done.\n\nSo I wasn't ravenous when my meal arrived, but I was certainly looking forward to some good eats. Alas, the chicken schwarma pita sandwich delivered the same mediocre impression. The chicken was overly dry and not well seasoned, and again, the pita was the star of the dish. \n\nI didn't have the Persian ice cream this time, but I have in the past. It's fairly cheap and delicious, so if any of you out there are interested in trying a flavor that's certainly not of the 31 at Baskin Robbins, give it a whirl. I'm considering giving this place another star based on the ice cream alone...but I can't bring myself to. So consider it a 3.5 star experience overall.\n\nI'm just glad the prices were reasonable for lunch, six or seven bucks for a sandwich. Otherwise, I might have felt a bit cheated. The ambiance was lacking as well, with generic cafeteria type seating (as stated before), and the service as attentive but awkward since we were the only people in there, so that leaves the food alone to shine.

The eggs benedict were done very well, but nothing really sets this dish apart from one you could get anywhere else, even with the atypical meat choices. \n\nIt was the Hawaiian pulled pork hash that was a total bummer on the plate. The hashbrowns were practically black in some places and mushy in others, and the pulled pork was a mass of dry, bland shredded meat.

If you're not ordering something hoity toity, the following formula applies: hot grill+eggs+meat+carb= breakfast. My stomach and I are proud to say inform you that J.P. Pancakes has mastered that formula. They even include some variables in the equation that will knock off your socks and spin them around your head.\n\nIt's the small, innocuous looking restaurant in a large strip mall, sandwiched between an Italian restaurant and whatever the hell was on the other side. It's not much to look at, but when the food is this good, it really doesn't matter. Just stick with it until your meal comes. And don't let the constant loop of incredibly shitty KYOT style smooth jazz scare you away. They're willing to turn the volume down, because the waitresses think it's pretty much shite as well.\n\nThey're known for their pancakes (duh), but I wasn't really in the mood for a sweet breakfast. I will definitely be coming here the next time that urge strikes though. Their oven baked fluffy cakes looked superb and come in apple, blueberry, strawberry, banana, german and german nutty varieties. Wowzer. There were even more regular pancake and Belgian waffle varieties, as well as traditional breakfast combos and omelets with some pretty cool stuff in them, like avocado or feta cheese. \n\nI opted for the Hong Kong Omelet, with sausage, wild mushrooms, onions, Monterey jack and cheddar cheese. Ohmygod. It was delicious and HUGE. The mushrooms were gigantic, like portabella size, because they were diced into big old pieces and you could hardly discern the shape of them. The bacon was thick and crispy and the sausage was also delicious. Mr. Man got it on the side with his breakfast. Let's just say it looked pretty phallic, more like a bratwurst than a little link sausage. You'll feel slightly dirty taking a succulent bite out this sucker.\n\nWhich brings me to the homefries. They are quite possibly some of the best side order potatoes I have ever had with breakfast. Crisp, small little squares seasoned to perfection. They were delicious alone, but perfection when sprinkled with hot sauce. I'm salivating just thinking of them right now. They were that freakin' good.\n\nIt's a little on the pricey side ($9.25 for my omelet and homefries, $8.25 for eggs, meat and fries) for breakfast, the ambiance kinda sucks, and it's located in the hell of old people infested Scottsdale suburbs (side note- we got to see some old biddy drive down the wrong part of the road, twice!) but their mastery of the breakfast art is truly something to wonder at.

The fries are pretty decent (it takes some real effort--or neglect--to fuck up french fries) but the onion rings leave a lot to be desired. \n \nI've tried a couple different hot sandwiches, including the Philly Original, and it's always a greasy, messy event.

That which we call cheap fucking drinks by any other name would still get us loaded. And who are you to argue with Shakespeare? He hates your crappy emo poems anyway.\n\nHuh. I guess I didn't know how strongly I felt about Monkey Pants until that verbal vomit just came spewing forth.\n\nAs a gesture of goodwill to those of you who I know I'll see at Time Out in the future, and will undoubtedly rib me for my irrational love of a place called Monkey Pants, I will concede the following point: it is most definitely not an evening drinking destination. \n\nIt is an excellent happy hour or weekend day drinking joint though. Discount 2.25 well and 1.75 domestic drafts between 5 and 7 (that only increase by a buck at regular prices)? Hell yes. An unlimited fount of free popcorn good for munching and launching? Check. An entire menu of good bar food if you're looking to absorb some of the alcohol sloshing around? You betcha. One of the best waitresses\/bartenders I have ever had the pleasure of tipping? Thanks for consistently getting me drunk, Krista! \n\nThere's pool, shuffle board, trivia cards, board games, kitschy paintings, a fake fireplace playing on loop, leg lamps, and enough televisions to send you into a pop culture coma with their soft, hypnotizing glow. This is the type of place where I can show up at five and drink straight through to ten or later without even knowing it, and thankfully, without even coming close to breaking the bank. \n\nI've been around for the \"wacky\" antics that others have brought up as negative (one o'clock shirtless shots, fish races, and thematic discounts--moustache Monday and wig Wednesday, and so on) but hardly anyone participates. And I've never been to Monkey Pants when it's exuded a \"frat bar atmosphere.\" Come during happy hour and you're more likely to see the local flavor propped up around the island bar (I dig an island bar) than the kind of people barhopping down the Mill Avenue strip. There's just enough buffer room to keep them at bay.\n\nSo if you're comfortable enough to put aside pretension and indulge in a little kitsch, I'm sure I'll be seeing you soon!\n\nAnd if that doesn't convince you, maybe these six little words will:\n\nBacon. Wrapped. Deep. Fried. Hot. Dog.\n\nA nacho cheese covered coronary on a bun. I never knew death could taste so delicious.","useful":8,"funny":6,"cool":8}

All you Yelpers must be in on some vast conspiracy to chat this place up on days when I'm outside sweating to the sweet sounds of backhoes instead of procrastinating on this site under the soul sucking fluorescent lights of the office.\n\nWell played.\n\nI wish I could say the same about Fate.\n\nMy dining partner (who is obviously in on the scheme as well) had heard rave reviews about this place from roommates and friends alike, so we swung by to grab a bite on a Thursday night. He was looking forward to a delectable Pan-Asian experience. I was just looking for something to satisfy my gnawing hunger. \n\nWe didn't have a very hard time finding the place, which seems to be a common complaint, and stumbled upon a cute little converted house with a group of five sipping beers outside as they waited for a table. Since they're on summer hours or something, only one of the two houses was open, and none of the cool outdoor decorations (aside from the wicked Buddah head) were present. Just a tiny little stylized sign that stated, \"Fate.\" \n\nI really hoped that the stars were about to align and the combined fury of the kitchen and wait staff would result in the culmination of its namesake. \n\nAfter entering the restaurant and approaching the hostess, I was startled by the number of empty tables in the place and pleased that we'd soon have some saucy, ricey goodness to sate our hunger. Unfortunately, that wasn't so. She made us wait outside, after specifically barring us from remaining indoors, for five minutes. Baffling, but no biggie. Then we were ushered into a tiny room at the front of the establishment that boasted Ikea decor and very little ambiance, so I can't even give it points on that basis, which also seems to be a big seller with reviewers. We also sat about a foot and a half from the table next to us and I had to listen to the most pretentious and vapid conversation I've been a party to in recent memory. Not good.\n\nThe waitress was very friendly and attentive, and we placed our order for a couple iced teas and the pot sticker appetizer. When it came time for us to order, she was great help with the menu and we decided on the Cantonese Black Dragon Beef and the Szechuan chicken. \n\nAfter paying four bucks for a bottle of Republic of Tea, which is by no means 'gourmet,' I was a little miffed but willing to ride out the experience and judge by food alone. Then the potstickers came on a bamboo platter and I felt those stars starting to drift into alignment. I raised one to my lips after dipping it into the sauce and the celestial bodies whizzed right by each other with no care for fulfilling their fate.\n\nThey were comparable to frozen Costco brand potstickers and the sauce they came with was heavy on soy sauce and light on any other flavor. I was too hungry to care so I scarfed my fair share, but my dining partner was completely turned off. Still, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, maybe it was an off night in the kitchen. Then the food arrived with a little side of rice. \n\nIt tasted a little better than your mom and pop corner shop Chinese, but it was on par with anything at P.F. Chang's. And if I can compare it to a nationwide chain, it doesn't deserve any more than a mediocre rating. My food was the perfect serving size, with just the right amount of rice, but the sauce was drastically different than any other szechuan dish I've ever had and the some of the chicken was diced into itsy bitsy little pieces that funked with the texture. I was really hungry, so I wasn't that critical, but my dining partner ate about three bites of his and declared, \"I'm never coming back here again.\" To put it simply, he thought it sucked. Hard.\n\nFate is a restaurant that seems to cater to individuals that place ambiance very highly in their dining experience. The food isn't great nor is it well priced, but I may have gone on an off night, so I'm willing to give it another shot and possibly adjust my review. I'll just have to find someone else to enjoy it with.","useful":5,"funny":5,"cool":6}

We were referred to this office by a friend when she found out my husband had colon issues. He is extremely sick and in need of the Dr. He set up an appt almost 2 weeks out. In that time he was not told he needed all his medical records sent over to the office. Even on the day of the appointment they still did not mention the medical records not being received. We waited in the waiting room for 35 minutes. Once called back the girl who worked there told us that the Dr. would not see us because he hasnt seen his medical records and that when my husband made the appointment the person who took notes did not mention that he has any prior or current issues. \nAre you kidding me? My husband totally loves going to a GI Dr. for fun. so they said they put in the request. This was on a Thursday. Friday afternoon 10 minutes to 5 I get \"we only have half the records, but the Dr. still wont see you.\" Monday comes and my husband calls again. Nope still no records. He went to the hospital directly and got everything that was need. He brought them back to the office only to be told the Dr. will review them. Tuesday comes and my husband calls only to be told \"something is missing and the Dr. still wont look at the records unless complete.\" At this point we know we are still getting the run around. So today is Wednesday. I call and for the first 10 calls the answering service was answering. I was told to keep calling maybe someone will answer. So finally I got an answer. I asked has the Dr. reviewed the records. I was put on hold. The office person then comes back and said the nurse was in with a patient and would call me back. I said no ill wait. 2 minutes later they came on the phone and said \"The Dr. wont see you. He said you need to go back to the Dr. that did your testing a year and a half ago.\"\nAre you kidding ME!!!!! After all the run around only to be told nope. That was a week's worth of wasting my time. \nThe staff there doesnt know what the hell they are doing. They are rude and could give 2 shits about the patient.

Luckily, in that time we'd decided on food, otherwise who knows how long it would have been before we could have ordered.\nWe had eaten most of our food and had a refill of chips on the way (thanks to a food runner) before our server brought out my friend's drink.\nShe'd forgotten it was at the bar, and instead of having a new one made, she'd brought the drink to the table with almost all the ice melted. We had to track her down again so we could ask to get a new one made.\nWe saw food runners and bussers more than twice the number of times we saw our actual server the whole night and the place was not busy at all.\n\nOn top of the less than stellar service, the food is overpriced for what you get. While yes, some of it is excellent and the concepts are interesting, most is mediocre at best.\n\nRecommendation:\nIf you do go there, choose earlier in the day when you'll spend less on game play.

I asked my girlfriend about her chicken ,chicken is her thing. She showed it to me and it was still pink and raw ,turned her off right of the bat and she didn't  even touch her ribs.The thing I enjoyed the most was the fries and she enjoyed the soup. If this is the kind of food they are pushing out its is very disappointing. this place is way over-rated, food wise. I expected fresh melt in your mouth brisket , Its a smoke house, and it fell way short of that. The thing this place has going for it is the staff and that's about it.

Later that day they said it would be bout 500 for a control arm thats cracked. But it's still pulling so they need to work on it. Later that same day they called and said it would be another hundred and something for another part. they were really sorry but they are trying to fix it but they keep find problems.  We went down to pay and see it is was down. when we got there they were test driving it. but told me the bill was now eight hundred and something. I was annoyed but just wanted my truck fixed. however when they were done with the test drive he said it's better but not perfect and ask for more time. we let them keep it a few more days but  when we would call for updates it was just a run around. \nI had a gut feeling something was wrong so we went down and said we just want the truck back. they gave us a speech about how it's a process and we should turn it into insurance because the whole front end on the passenger side needs to be replaced. I said hell no and took my truck home on the way I noticed if you hold the wheel level it now went to the left and it you let go it quick pulled to the right. so I had to fight to keep it straight.

That of course means I need supplys, as my other dog \"Luna\" has her own beds and kennel. While I was walking around an employee who we believe was a supervisor approached us and ask if we needed help. She then went on to explain about this puppy coupon book. It was 19.99 and it gave you a discount on a kennel mat, which she said even though it said Kong mats they could use it for any of them. Then there was a discount on food bowls, she again said any kind. Discount on treats and food. Lastly there were so great discounts on training. Classes, doggie daycare etc. So we're thinking great this will help a lot. \n\nThe kennels were pretty expensive, they have one thats a camping kennel. It's great as the dog gets old as she's a small breed and will me sleeping in it next to my bed. It was 59.99 but the one I purchased for my other dog at another business was 25. \n\nThe bowl selection was okay, they was a lot of glass and plastic ones. I preffer the stainless steel. I found a nice one for a fair price. \n\nFood is the reason I come here. They have a great selection and hills makes a food Luna loves so we grabbed there puppy food and I though it was a good price at 15.00.\n\nTreats a toys we had no issues finding.\n\nWhen we went to check out the line was backed up and only one cashier. I thought this was going to become a nightmare quick as the customer at the register was a \"complicated order\". But the cashier noticed the line and got some help. \nThis is were out visit went down hill. The lady that came up started ringing us up. Telling us nearly every item we got wasn't covered but the coupons. We tried to explain that we picked items that an employee directed us to. She just said \"well who told you that, what's there name what do the look like.\" Lucky enough the supervisor walked by and the cashier didn't bother to ask her what she told us.  So we were just not going to get the coupon book. Then the camping kennel rang up as .01 so the second cashier said they cannot sale it. I told her you have it on the shelf with a price and item I'd number on the shelf that matches the item, what do you mean I cannot buy it. She said they .01 means they don't carry the item anymore and cannot sale it. It means they used to carry it. It's a kong brand that they have a large selection of sizes. They had 12 or more of varying sizes. Her logic blew my mind, \"we used to carry it\" hello I have the item in my hand so you clearly still do. They did not bother to ask a manager. Also we were not asking for a discount. So petsmart would have made 200.00 but instead I left everything and went to a cheaper competitor and got the same bed for half. \n\nI am loyal to company's that treat me well and value my business as well as empower there people to keep the sale.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I recently purchased an XJ not from here. They had one that was a great price and I test drove it and man Jag does know how to make a smooth ride. However, I was trading in a ram truck and the dealership wanted to lowball me on the trade because of the tax credit. It's frustrating to me as I am not a novice to buying cars I have bought and sold 50 plus cars. So I did my research and math before I came here. I knew what the trade value was on my truck, but of course the dealership says they don't use blue book, black book, edmonds or nada which is fine I don't expect full trade value but they came in 5 k less. When I told the sales me what another dealership offered he told me to go there. So I did and bought an Xj from them and sold my truck. \n\nHowever, there was an issue with the seat heater. For some reason, it only worked when the car was in park. No worry's I took it to this dealership's service department as it had factory warranty on it and was covered. I explained the problem and left my car. The service rep was very nice and helpful, made me feel very welcomed and valued, unlike the sales person. \n\nThey called me a few days later saying there's no issue with the heater and I can come get it. They said they turned the car on and tested it with a thermometer and it heats up fine. I told them that I know it works with the car is in park, but I don't drive around in park. So I asked them to read the notices that the service rep made when I explained how to recreate the issue and call me when its fixed. \n\nA week later and they are replacing the heater unit. \nAll in all I have very mixed feelings as the service level I received is so up and down.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The tables are all branded with the circle h logo, which is actually a brand once used on a family farm. Pictures of the family hang on the walls to admire as you wander about the space and there is a lot of room to socialize and enjoy some great barbecue.\n\nI've been waiting ages for this place to open, and upon hearing of their first official day of their soft opening (grand opening coming in a month or so), I was able to convince a few friends to swing in to grab some dinner. While everything on the menu wasn't there, most of it was. Well, aside from the Dr. Pepper cake which I am now dying to try. The menu consists of appetizers, some common, some uncommon, like the grilled cheese sandwich trio I think will be a frequent meal and the gringo nachos. Salads are available as well as sandwiches, platters and huge combo meals that will probably cover a family for a decent price. \n\nI had the brisket sandwich, and the others in my party had the Memphis Flyer (pulled pork + slaw). The food came quickly in a basket with the typical red and white checkered paper. Mine came with the sauce on the side, which is homemade. While the brisket needed no sauce, it was too good to resist and I loaded it on. The bun never got too soggy and hard to manage and the barbecue was amazing. It was enough for a meal too without feeling too full. \n\nThey are still in the process of opening, and as such all the decorations aren't yet up and the bar is not available quite yet, but this should not keep you from trying it out soon. The patio is gorgeous, the people are great, and it's another great reuse of space by a great local business owner.

It was very delicious. The rice was slightly dry and not very flavorful, and wasn't my favorite, but it was a nice addition to the jerk chicken, which had some decent spice to it, actually probably a little more than the curry from what I remember. \n\nThe plantains, oh the sweet plantains were PHE NOM IN AL!!!!!! Well worth it.  In addition we had a side of roti for the curry order and it was some delicious bread. Probably the best bread I've had aside form nan. Why do other countries make bread so much better than us? Is it because we all try to swear ourselves off of carbs?\n\nTo drink, I had pink ting. I know, not surprising. It was a carbonated pink grapefruit beverage using Jamaican pink grapefruit, bottled in Jamaica, but a product of Canada. That made me giggle, but it was delicious. And, well, the name itself makes it worthy.\n\nOverall, this place was reasonably priced, and allowed us to enjoy our meal slowly, and talk for hours afterwards. The staff is truly genuine.

The vines growing along the side and the umbrellas suspended from the roof are simply magnificent. The place settings are beautiful, and listening to the birds tweet as they hop around all while a great breeze blows makes it instantly calming enough to warrant going by yourself, serene enough for talking business, and sexy enough for a date. \n\nThe staff is phenomenal, and our server, Bri, was just the best ever. She helped me through some very tough Sunday morning meal decisions as well as explained all about Caffe Boa and how many of their items on their dinner and new brunch menu are made from scratch, organic, and\/or locally grown. The brunch menu also has only been around a few weeks. I'm glad that I stopped by before word spreads.\n\nI started off with the white sangria, which wasn't sold by the glass until brunch. Additionally, during brunch, the pitchers of sangria are half off. The glass was huge and full of flavor and goodness. It was filled with apples, grapes, oranges, and cherries and was absolutely delightful. After the sangria, I had to try the mimosa, and I was not disappointed. Mimosas, Bellini, and champagne are 8 per glass or 18 bottomless at brunch. And yes, you can mix and match them. It may sound a little pricey, but they would kick the ass of the 2 dollar mimosas many places have. Total weaklings they are compared to this masterpiece.\n\nAfter going round and round on just what I wanted to order, I settled on the eggs benedict which had prosciutto, poached eggs, and basil hollandaise over an English muffin. On the side was an amazing goat cheese and tomato (though I did without tomato). I added some cracked pepper and unbleached wine rock salt. Decadent. Simply exquisite. I don't typically care for salt and I couldn't help but keep putting a tiny pinch on my meal. \n\nThe service was just the right speed for a brunch, not too fast and not too slow. I don't like to be rushed on a Sunday morning. I was able to enjoy myself and take in the amazing food I was eating as well as enjoy the scenery, which made me believe I really had been transported to a gorgeous countryside when I walked in the door. \n\nI will gladly come here again for brunch, and despite my typical dislike of pasta, the description Bri gave us, has me craving that as well.\n\nIt was decadent down to every last tiny detail and I left completely satisfied from head to toe, like I had been on a romantic getaway or a day at the spa.","useful":6,"funny":1,"cool":4}

Let me tell you. We sat there beside it, unable to wait until we drove elsewhere to eat. I loved the research they did into the authenticity and the prices were very reasonable. The wrappers for the sandwiches have facts about the country as well as their relationship with the United States. They are so well designed I took a spare and still have it as a keepsake.\n\nBonus was that you could technically order vegetarian, though you won't get the full experience. Someone ordered a sandwich with no meat shortly after us, which meant bread and mint pretty much. They looked like they still enjoyed it.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

As a child, that's where we always had a membership. A YMCA is where I took swim lessons, where I learned I am not good at indoor soccer, even if it does involve cute jr high boys, and where my dad took me with him to use the real gym for the first time. There's something about YMCAs that make you feel like home, and the Chris-Town YMCA is no different. \n\nThe staff, first and foremost, is very friendly. From my first visit to every one after, they've always been kind and answered any questions I have had, no matter how silly. \n\nThe instructors are the same way. I took my first ever spin class here, and I didn't feel like an idiot when I wasn't sure how the hell to set that bike up. And no one judged me for the sad looks on my face when any gear above 14 was mentioned. Oh. And the bike class was outside that morning. Awesome!! The zumba class on Thursday nights is a great mix of different types of people at all different skill levels. And the studio it's in is gorgeous. \n\nSo speaking of gorgeous, that's what this place is. The colors on the outside and inside within the studio and the entry walls are so bright and colorful. It makes you want to get moving. The studio where zumba and other classes are held is amazing. The bright paint, the new floors and the windows looking outside can't be very old. There is a brand new gym with a basketball court that is phenomenal.  \n\nStandard gym equipment applies, but is very well kept. After a few weeks, I have still yet to see one that is out of order. The gym area is packed with treadmills, ellipticals,standard weight machines and free weights also, and always seems to be packed. That is the one slight downfall. Sometimes you will have to wait if you want to use a treadmill or elliptical. However, I've never had to wait long and come on, pick up a pair of weights or something. Or use the amazing rock climbing treadmill wall thing they have. This YMCA also has the fitlinxx system that lets you keep track of your progress. Way to go!!\n\nThe only downfall so far, is that they haven't had an operational membership card machine since before I started. Therefore, I still have yet to get my membership card which makes it not feel as real. I'm sure the minute I come in with the most terrible workout getup known to mankind, it will magically be fixed.

The only problem was, everything I thought of, I didn't think I'd want years down the road. I love accessories, but I'm pretty picky about anything permanent. Last year, I finally decided, and had a friend draw up some sketches around my idea. The result was something I couldn't *not* get inked. And when I started asking around, everyone pointed me to Heather at Lady Luck. \n\nHeather has a quaint little shop in Braggs Pie Factory. Heather has a pink glittery art piece of a unicorn. I was in love with it. She was in love with my tattoo. It was a match made in heaven. \n\nI worked with Heather for about 4 months before the big day. I showed her my sketch. We discussed the procedure and prices. I had the sketch stenciled on me in at least two different places so I could try out places before the day came. I called her. I emailed her. I asked her a million paranoid questions. I was sure she'd be annoyed with me by the time the day came. \n\nI went in, and Heather had a TV set up for while I was there and a stand that I could easily set my water and phone on. I brought a few movies of my own and my ipod, but I didn't even use them. We ended up watching one of her movie and laughing and talking about it the whole time. She finished the piece in nearly no time at all, which pretty much takes up the front part of the top of my left arm, but is only in black and white in a little over an hour. And only the bottom of Dot's dress hurt, and even that pain was tolerable. I was surprised. I had completely planned on freaking out and ending up with a toe or something and that's it. Instead, I walked out with the most gorgeous thing I could imagine, an appointment for a tiny touch up a few months later, and great instructions on how to care for it. \n\nAnd still I called a few more times, unsure if what I was experiencing was normal. And no one yelled at me or became annoyed (at least to my face). And the touchup was free. \n\nHere I am about 8 months later, with a tattoo that to this day, gets way too much attention. But hey, that's part of the reason you get one right? Everyone loves Dot. And I love telling the story of how quick and painless it was and referring everyone that wants a great inking experience to head to Heather. \n\nI'm not sure I could ever pick a better piece than Dot, but if I decide to get a second, this is where I'll head.","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":2}

As starving as we were, we probably ate way more chips than we should have and started in on a pitcher of sangria. By the way, the sangria had no fruit in it.. I think they removed it before they put it in the pitcher. VERY disappointing. \n\nAfter we were finally allowed to leave the cougar area and head to the main establishment, the food was just meh in my opinion. Interestingly enough when our food came, our waitress brought it out and then just walked away leaving it on the fold out serving tray and not delivering it to our table. The tacos a friend ordered were taunting him horrendously. Mine came with the wrong side dish which meant I had to constantly push it out of the way. \n\nThe fried ice cream was good, but not the best I've had.\n\nIn the end, this was just a good learning experience...but it was great to be back amongst friends.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":1}

The bowling balls were behind the counter. Is this normal in AZ? I understand people seem to love to steal the shoes, but do people really try to steal bowling balls? It totally sucked to have to go to the counter to test out bowling balls between frames to find a good weight.\n\nThey kind of made up for this by having PBR on tap, but were brought back down again by not having the ginger in the Jameson & Ginger as advertised. Upon asking, they made a ginger ale (the coke crap) and well I really wanted some so it was acceptable. I remember my quote being, \"This isn't bad for a fake ginger ale & Jameson.\" I'm not quite sure if I liked that they came and got my order at the lanes or not. They were pretty insistent on me not heading to the bar to order my drink, even though I had no clue what they had, so I needed to scope it out. If you want to server people, that's fantastic. Really. I'm a fan. But have the menu by the lanes.\n\nAll in all the lanes were easy to use and we didn't have too many issues we needed assistance with other than a bowling ball that kept getting stuck in the return.

That's what comes with renting and not owning. When I first moved to the area, I was having issues finding what I wanted. That was until I found out there was a new development with two level apartments. I fell in love and moved in. \n\nAlta is a nice community with a greenbelt, pool, community club house, gym, walking paths, playground, community grills and a dog park. There are several different layouts to pick and all of them are two story with a garage. Vaulted ceilings add to their charm. \n\nOverall I enjoyed living there and the community was gorgeous. Very green grass, gorgeous little courtyard areas between apartments. Several times people would not believe me when I said they were rentals. \n\nHowever, over time, it didn't remain in the same condition it was in when I moved. More ASU students and so forth have started moving in and abusing the rules. I like to party as much as the next, but what I don't like is waking up at 6am because someone decided it was appropriate to stop in the middle of the road by my place, start their car and just get out of it and leave it running for a half hour.  I didn't enjoy the people walking their dogs without leashes. To clarify, I love dogs, and I've had dogs running loose in my own yard. But not everyone likes dogs and you may walk past someone who is scared. Your dog may also become spooked for some reason and react. I didn't enjoy people ignoring the no glass in the pool rule, which resulted in the pool having to be emptied, cleaned and refilled.. especially when it was hot out. I also didn't enjoy one pool. The community is built on an old golf course and was way too big for one pool. It has two different addresses and entrances for crying out loud.\n\nAlso note there's a mandatory valet trash fee. This is so you don't have to take your trash to the big bin that's probably not too far from your house. \n\nMaintenance was fairly reliable but I did find myself having to call to find out what happened with a call or double check to make sure someone did make the call on occasion. Moving out was for the most part painless. I cleaned and made sure everything was in pristine condition and turned my keys in and was done with it. \n\nIn the end, it's a nice place.

Candace never minded repeating the drink menu items as we didn't have but one of those menus on the table for all 10 of us. \n\nOur food came out quickly and all at the same time. Drinks were delivered with flair. Everyone spent the first few minutes moaning in happiness. Following it were a few moments of extreme gratitude for the delicious food and then a lot more silence as we devoured our meals without feeling like we were in a hurry any longer. \n\nThe bills were brought out.. separate... to everyone right as some of us were about finished and needed to start thinking about a ride to the airport. It was beautiful. Despite gratuity being included, I believe we all included extra because we truly appreciated our service and meals that night.\n\nIn fact, I can never finish my fries and FEZ burger so I had half sitting there and one of my friends asked if they could have some of it as it was so delicious the first time he had it.\n\nI love you FEZ, and I always will. You truly impressed me all over again, and left a great impression of what Phoenix has to offer on visitors.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":2}

I went to two dealerships because one I was familiar with and closer to my home, and the other had the exact car I wanted. I should have never made that second trip.\n\nI already put car salesman at a lower bar than other people in my mind, but this was a whole new level of low. If you don't want to end your day wanting to staple things to people's heads, I would stay away from this dealership.\n\nI walked into the dealership knowing what I wanted. I still wanted to browse first, but I had researched. This is also not my first car buying experience, and not my first Mazda. I am well aware of the line. Oh yeah, and I'm also a car fanatic. \n\nI didn't mind being hunted down by a salesman right away because I had really already knew what I wanted. It was coincidental that without saying what I wanted, the first car he decided to show me was the one I had seen in their online inventory. \n\nSoon enough I was on a test drive. Great car as expected. I asked some simple questions such as if I could have more details on the specifics of the particular perimeter alarm that was installed on that car to which the salesman did not have an answer. Makes me think it would have been fun to ask him what was under the hood.\n\nWe all know that what comes next is the fun part. And by fun, I mean extremely annoying process that takes 10 times longer than it should - the negotiating process. The first part was estimating the trade in value of my car though he decided to wrap this up in the first round of pricing negotiations. Right off the bat I was undercut by a couple grand at least on my trade in. Not cool. \n\nI told him that the trade in value wasn't acceptable and asked if I could find out the specific price plan I was eligible for to which I received a blank look. I would expect a dealership employee to know the various standard pricing plans. I also let him know I wanted to know what other offers were available. After waiting awhile, he came back with no change in the trade in, but did give me the pricing plan I was eligible for.\n\nSince it was still not where it needed to be, I explained to him what I was looking for. I told him my situation and that I did not need to buy a new car. I told him that my car was perfectly fine and in amazing condition and that I wasn't desperate. I let him know the price I had gotten down to at another dealership and where I ideally wanted to be. I said I didn't want to play negotiation games and I wanted to know how close he could get me.\n\nThings quickly got out of line. I was treated with great disrespect as I was given excuse after excuse and attack after attack. At one point he recommended I lease and when I explained to him I did not want to lease I was given a rant of how I don't put enough miles on my car and it's stupid for me to buy. Really? Okay. I'm out then. If that wasn't enough I was also attacked for asking what the lowest price was. I was asked if I wanted the company to lose money all while he kept informing me that he gets paid on commission, which goes by the number of cars he sells. I guess maybe I looked like I didn't know how car dealerships worked and how the car buying process goes. At one point he asked again where I wanted to be payment wise, to which I told him. He then put a range down on a scrap piece of paper with an x and a line below it and told me to sign. When I said I wasn't comfortable signing a scrap piece of paper below a payment price range without any detail or further information, he became very agitated.\n\nIn the end I let him know that this wasn't going anywhere and that I didn't think the price was going to be where I needed it to be. I told him that with the economy the way it is, that I figured the price would be lower. When I purchased my other car in a much better economy I was able to get a better deal. I asked if I could have my pricing plan certificate back and was given a very sarcastic, \"You can have whatever you want.\"\n\nI was so repulsed by the way I was treated. I emailed customer service at the dealership and never received a response. I cannot believe they would ignore a situation like this, though with the only other review being a 1, I am not that surprised anymore. \n\nSlightly more detail is available on my blog, but I didn't want to write a novel here unless it was wanted.

My first visit there was for the Bears\/Packers Monday night game last year and it was complete mayhem, and I wouldn't have had it any other way. The typical \"fight songs\" played at Lambeau are played during commercial breaks and screamed by the fans. You can't find anyone in there not sporting their green and gold and it's hard to find a seat or standing spot unless you are there an hour or more ahead of time. It screams home for all of us that left the frozen tundra.\n\nHowever, I think one hazardous flaw was made this year. They closed for renovation and nothing on their website hinted at anything of the sort. Therefore, people that don't head to Old Town all the time and come those few times a year for the games where being with your own kind is of importance had no idea unless they would've tried to call, and who calls to make sure a Packers bar is open the night they play the Vikings with Favre adorned in purple? Nevertheless, I arrived an hour before the game to find out they weren't open an that nearly a dozen people also did not get the memo. The construction worker there had no suggestions of where to go and there was no note on the door from management. They said they had been having people stop by all day asking, and had no suggestions.\n\nI missed pre game due to having to drive to another bar. Mabel Murphys really disappointed me last night.

Service - Um.... not.\n\nI've been hearing rave reviews about Stax for ages. Hard to believe it took until today to get there, but with a case of the Mondays a coworker and I headed there for lunch hoping some fresh air and good food would rejuvenate us. \n\nThe air was indeed fresh, and the food was delicious. I really loved the laid back atmosphere that we had during lunchtime. And there's definitely something fun about the entrance from the parking lot. \n\nThe menu looked delicious and the idea of items small enough that I can try more than one always makes the indecisive crazy in my happy and quiet. We started with the tots as a starter and chipotle aioli. Presentation is pretty top notch at Stax. I loved that little fryer basket. Reminded me of the little shopping cart at Delux. Love :)\n\nFor lunch I went ahead with the exotic burger of the day which was rabbit with mushrooms and tomato and the shrimp po'boy with better battered shrimp, onion, tomato and a delicious sauce... both with no tomato for me. They came exactly as I ordered and were wonderful. I honestly can't tell you which one I liked more; they were both fantastic in their own special unique way. \n\nWhy the 3 stars then? The service left tons to be desired. Everytime we asked a question or wanted to order something, it was like we were being a pain and chore to our server. She always rushed her answers, never looked at us, never smiled, and always mumbled. I wish I could say I ordered an arnold palmer, but it definitely had no tea and the lemonade was so watered down it was as if I simply replaced my cucumber water with lemon water. \n\nAt the end when we had finished our burgers, we still were enjoying our tots. Our server came over to ask if we needed anything else as she cleared our main plates to which we said no.\n\nThen.. the unthinkable happened.\n\nShe took the rest of our tots without asking if we were finished. \n\nI've heard such good things, that I'll give it another go... but if I get bad service twice, Stax is off my list.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":0}

It only lasted slightly over 7 minutes. \n\nI have only had one day at the gym so far, but was so impressed by what I saw, encountered, and learned that I needed to tell my story. \n\nSaturday I headed there to make use of the personal training that was available to me for the weight loss competition Gangplank is putting on. I have my own gym, and I love going there for the dance classes, but I figured a personal trainer couldn't hurt. I'd had one before at a previous gym and it was great. \n\nI arrived not really knowing what to expect other than I was going to have a person assessment done that would then be used as a periodic benchmark to measure my progress. \n\nCompetitive Fitness is a small gym with a big personality. They strive to help people maintain a healthy lifestyle, not to make people lose a million pounds. There are only two types of machines available - the treadmill which is used for warming up and the rowing machines. Most of the exercises done are based on movements the body does naturally.\n\nI was greeted almost immediately upon entering and was brought to a treadmill to warm up while one of the trainers, Sally, went over what I would be doing that day and how the gym works. About halfway into it, I met with Jason, who was going to be going through my assessment with me. I think I gained more knowledge about fitness during this visit than I ever had in my entire life. I also learned I did not know how to use a rowing machine and I am way more coordinated when I'm dancing. \n\nThen it was time to do my assessment. It was so intense that I was a little light headed and needed a million gallons of water when I was done. Later that day I felt it in my legs (and still do today). It was also only 7 minutes. It felt like forever and throughout the entire thing, everyone else in the gym that was working out or hanging around was cheering me on. It was so incredible. I've never felt that level of community and enthusiasm in a gym and it really does help. \n\nTomorrow I will start my regular training. Each day there is a set routine or list of exercises everyone that stops in performs. A trainer is there to walk through the proper way to do the exercises and to help along the way. They are also timing you. At the end your time is posted on the board. This not only helps track progress but creates that competitive environment that really does help regardless of what people say. \n\nIt's a great way to think about training and fitness and I'm looking forward to the next few weeks here. Depending on how this goes, I am looking to switch from my current gym to this one when my membership runs out. If I could pay for two at one time, I might consider doing it sooner.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The restaurant smelled intoxicating. If that wasn't enough the decor wooed me in the rest of the way. We were seated promptly and given menus to review. \n\nOne of my favorite things off the bat was that our waitress Naomi didn't ask us what we wanted to drink, she asked if we wanted anything aside from water. I liked knowing that either way, I was getting something while I made a decision on dinner. \n\nAnd, well, that was a pretty hard decision. The menu has countless items I am still craving now after reading them hours before. I ended up having the red salmon curry, which was accompanied by sticky rice and steamed zucchini, broccoli, sprouts, carrots, mushrooms, and bamboo shoots. It was so phenomenal that half of me was sad I was unable to finish it all but the other half was excited my taste buds would get to experience it for lunch tomorrow. \n\nThe service was truly top notch and everything was prompt and genuine. From our server to the owner, I can do nothing but compliment them repeatedly. That alone makes me anxious to return.

But if you want to up my chances of going anywhere in Scottsdale, make them available during lunch hours. \n\nAt first glance I was only somewhat impressed. The decor and feel was very empty and sparse. Almost as if it had no vibe, but I'd heard great things about the food and beverage selection, and the hostess gave me props on my Pliny the Elder shirt (hopefully she wasn't making fun of me), so I was anxious to see what else was in store.\n\nIt was a Saturday night around 7, and apparently the place was booked until 9, though it looked really empty, and we were promised it would liven up soon as we sat at the bar.\n\nThe bacon fat popcorn quickly started to make up for the concerns I had. The whiskey concoction I had started to as well, until I realized they did have 12 and 18 year Jameson reserve but told me they didn't when I asked if my drink could be made with that.\n\nThe recommendation to have the Chopped Salad pretty much was the most amazing thing ever. It changed my life. It is my quest now to recreate this masterpiece in my home. I cried when I finished. I didn't want it to end, and I typically don't even like arugula!!\n\nSo the day wasn't a bust and I definitely will head back again.

I think I ended up in Chase Field's parking.\n\nThe building is nice and clean but small. The size suited us well, but there was a lack of easy access to food other than the one cart. Would've been nice to have other offerings even if we weren't in a newer and bigger portion of the center. \n\nThe staff was friendly from the few interactions I had and the rooms were decent sized. However, when the air was turned on, there was a buzzing sound in every room that was similar to a vacuum being ran. Had to deal with it unless you wanted to sweat. \n\nWifi not being free is also a bummer.","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":2}

Hesitant, I went to the counter and asked to look at some flush mount lights for a hallway that are more of a brushed metal finish.\n\nWhat did I end up finding? Lights for everything I needed that were exactly what I was picturing in my head. The price probably exceeds Home Depot, but these aren't your typical lights. After doing some price comparison, the lights were very reasonably priced and I went in the next day to place an order. Jennifer, the woman that helped me previously, answered all my questions and helped me with everything. In the end, they were even able to swing a discount on some of the items, thus lowering the price more.\n\nIf you are looking for lights in Phoenix, please ignore all the misconceptions about insanely high prices at Hinkley's.

The perfect size. The perfect combination and proportion of ingredients. Carnitas that made me want to marry it. \n\nThere was a long wait for tables so I ordered my food to go. I put my name in as well but had already eaten because I was starving. I sat at a table ready to crank out some work while waiting for a flight. \n\nGetting into a table with a carry on and a laptop bag is nearly impossible. I don't know why restaurants in airports continue to do this. This is a new restaurant.

Why 2 then?\n\nIf he was serious, that's bullshit. If he was saying it to clear the table, it's still bullshit. And that's exactly what I did. As soon as I got to a stopping point I got up and left. No one said see you again soon. No one said have a good flight. In fact, I heard him laugh as I walked away. \n\nI'm sorry, but in an airport, you need to be sensitive to why someone is sitting in your restaurant. Sometimes it's because it's the only decent choice. Sometimes it's because they arrived batshit early scared to miss their flight. And sometimes, it's because their flight is delayed a few hours and they don't want to sit on a crappy airport chair. Or there isn't even one of those available.  Most of those scenarios are not good. You have a captive audience. People aren't driving from downtown Phoenix to Sky Harbor to eat at the airport Blanco and go home immediately after. And if I am starving and I order take out because a table is not available but still want to sit, don't be an ass.\n\nI love your food, but the service is enough that I'll go elsewhere next time.

They had some amazing wines on the list, including New Age, which I am sure I have everyone hooked on now, and most of them didn't even try it on ice. They also had this wine-a-rita mix that was to die for. I had like two glasses and bought the mix. It's very good with fruit forward wines.\n\nOur party was given our own roped off area outside which was nice considering the gorgeous weather and as a bonus we were then able to listen (and sometimes dance) to the Greek music from the restaurant next door. It was a great place to have a great conversation and enjoy some fantastic wines. This tasting was pick your own from a list rather than everyone having every wine in the same order, and I was impressed at how the staff remembered what we all wanted every time and we had a group of about 14 people.\n\nSometimes I forget about Wine Styles because it's a chain, but I'm always happy when I end up there.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":2}

This place also holds a special place in my heart because it was my first real meal in Arizona. This is where I went to lunch on my first trip out here for an interview. It's also a favorite place for my coworkers and I to visit. \n\nFirst things first. The atmosphere is fantastic. The inside and outside both have great seating and I love the welcome feel you get when you arrive from both the staff and the decor. The outdoor seating area is one of the best I've ever seen. If you've never sat in between the outdoor bar and the pond, you are truly missing out. \n\nThe food is always fantastic, well portioned, and well priced. Blue corn enchiladas are one of my favorites. Warning though, do not eat them if you are not a fan of cheese. I, however, live for cheese and am in love with them. The lunch specials they have are *always* incredible and definitely worth trying. I don't know anyone that's ever been disappointed by them. Last time I was there it was roasted chicken enchiladas with a mushroom cream sauce. Can I say please eat me now?\n\nIf you enjoy fantastic food, amazingly personable staff, and a great setting, this is a must!","useful":4,"funny":2,"cool":3}

Seriously, you all call yourselves my friends? I'm disappointed and saddened everyone kept this secret to themselves.\n\nAs usual I was craving breakfast this morning and was able to convince the amazing Tony A. to meet me somewhere. He recommended Ticoz. I will go out on a limb and say this probably ties for one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. Similar to Bri D., I am practice a non-tomato diet, and therefore, usually have issues with many places I eat at. I suspected I would have to order everything today minus tomato. However, I was clearly wrong.\n\nLet's start with the salsa and chips. For brunch. Yum. One of the salsas was pineapple based, which in itself would've made me completely content. Had my breakfast not arrived in a timely fashion I would've asked for them to take the other two away and replace it with three bowls of the pineapple salsa. Establishments that can make a great salsa without the use of tomatoes are hard to find. Along with my salsa and chips (I swear I didn't eat the salsa only with a spoon despite my desire to) I had a $2 mimosa. Yep. Only $2. It was super fantastic and had minimal amount of pulp which I also appreciate, not to mention that it looked sunshiny and happy.\n\nI went with the huevos rancheros for breakfast, which is comprised of 3 eggs any way you like, green chili, pulled pork, and potatoes. Um, please Sir, may I have another? It was one of those just about perfectly sized meals (had I not front loaded on salsa and chips) that made me all happy inside as I consumed it. The server told me it would be spicy. It did have a kick, but a little more of one would've been welcome.\n\nStepping away from the food, the service was prompt and the staff was super friendly from the moment I walked in the door before I could take my sunglasses off until I was headed out the door on my way home. Very conversational. Very prompt. Very much appreciated. The prices were also extremely reasonable. Although the menu for brunch is limited, at least half the items appealed to me, which means there is hope of a future trip.\n\nI adored the laid back decor which was perfect on a Sunday morning. The colors were warm and inviting and the seating was creative. The bigger chairs at the table though almost don't work for short people, but I managed. I want to go back again.

The easy part most people get is that it works like most other fro-yo places in the area where you make your own concoction and pay by the weight. However, there's lots of organic yummy stuff too. Their smoothies use yogurt instead of milk from what I was told (which sounded heavenly). \n\nIt looked like there were a ton of toppings to choose from and about 7 or so different flavors of fro-yo.

Why people want seeds all up in their smoothie is something I don't yet understand.

The lobby is exquisite and I want that wall treatment in my next house. The rooms are well thought out and modern and stylish. When you first enter, the lights are on for you, and soothing instrumental music is playing from the alarm clock. That right there was enough to make me want to fall asleep. Then I made the mistake of laying on the bed. I have to revoke my claim that I have the worlds comfiest bed. This bed was so seductive that I went to bed at 10:30 that first Friday night. Yes you heard me. 10:30. Lights out for Tonia.\n\nI enjoyed having Gallo Blanco right in the same building as well as the rooftop bar, which made for a great Saturday night. When I left Sunday morning, for some reason my 2nd night was charged to my account, but Matthew, who was working the front desk carefully went through and corrected the situation for me. He was awesome.\n\nMy only complaint about the Clarendon is that I'd love to see some cute glassware instead of the disposable cups in the rooms. Also, being that it's an old building, despite having four or five routers for guests, I was never able to get a wireless signal, and was told by the front desk they barely get one either. There should be some way to make that work.\n\nWith reasonably priced, modern, comfortable as hell rooms and a staff that will sweep you off your feet, I'll definitely be back.","useful":6,"funny":3,"cool":6}

He also asked questions about my affairs in order to create the documents needed. Ends up I just needed a simple estate planning package with a few different documents. \n\nI left that day giving Heath the information he needed to draft the documents. Since I didn't live nearby, he emailed me drafts of the documents when they were complete for me to review. I was able to ask any questions I had before hand and when I showed up to pick up the documents, all I had to do was sign and pay the small fee that was charged. Witnesses were available and everything was painless. \n\nI highly recommend visiting Heath for any estate planning needs.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":2}

I had an hour to kill before a dinner appointment at Tempe Marketplace, and figured it the perfect chance. \n\nThe man that met me at my car tried to read me at nearly every point in the conversation and adjust his next line\/tone appropriately, but made it very apparent he was doing so and it almost made me walk out. I told him I needed a wash and a hand wax and that I had an hour tops in order to have this done. He tried to then sell me on a detail, which my car didn't need at the time. After I told him such he's like \"Oh yeah. Looks like you are right on track of what your car needs and when. The inside looks fine.\"\n\nAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.\n\nI was glad to get away from him and inside.\n\nI went and paid and the inside is your typical upscaled car wash approach that's happened as of late. There were some televisions playing various general channels, some snacks, some random shit for your car, some blue mountain greeting cards (I totally thought those were only e-cards from the mid 90's) and some various seating where you can watch your car at different stages. You can also watch outside which is nice. \n\nI like to watch my car when it's being washed, serviced, what not. I like to know what's going on. Call me an overly possessive parent and you are probably right. My car's my baby. Sadly, I had to move three times in the process of my car being washed to keep an eye on it. I wonder if they do this on purpose. \n\nWhen it was done I stood up to head over. A man asked me if my brakes were bad, to which I responded no and then asked why. He told me they made a loud noise. When I told him it was probably because they were wet he insisted it was not and that I should get my brakes checked. Ends up they didn't make any noise at all, it was another car and he didn't know what the hell he was talking about.\n\nOn the good side, they did take damn good care of my car, so the next time I feel a little feisty after a long day, I'll head over here to have my car washed.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The first and only trip was enough for me. However, about two months or so ago, I was invited to a lunch for a project I was on, and I hesitantly went. The lunch was back to back with a meeting I had... knowing this, and my issues last time, I arrived a half hour early with another coworker to make sure my order was in. We each ordered three rolls if I remember correctly. After we ordered, the others arrived (please note, it took a half hour to be able to put our order in... even though no one was in the restaurant).\n\nEveryone else began to put theirs in as well and sushi and other ordered items began to arrive. 20 more minutes passed and I soon realized everyone had their food but me. Even those that ordered after. It was now close to my time to leave so I flagged down our server and asked him if I could have my sushi to go. I wasn't extremely hungry, but knew I would be craving something by mid afternoon.\n\nIt all went downhill from here. Rather than checking on my order or anything else for that matter, I was attacked and accused of not putting an order down. After all, had it been, it obviously would've been at the table. After 5 minutes of several people ensuring him my order was on a list, I gave up and said to just bring me a philly roll quick so I can not starve myself. One of my coworkers graciously gave up his take home items so I could eat. I was ever thankful.\n\nI left angry and upset...but thanks to friends not completely starving. The food was good, but quickly overlooked by the terrible service I've received both times I've been here. Honestly the food is the only thing that gives them the 2nd star. I bitched on twitter about my disdain and soon had a message from their corporate office. They wanted to call me to discuss the matter with that locale. I told them I didn't really wish to speak with the locale. What's done is done. I wasn't sure what they could honestly say to make me feel better about how I was treated.\n\nKabuki responded with a rather generous gift card. I decided I would give them one more shot (after all, it was on the house). Honestly I was scared to use it... even with the meal being free, I wasn't sure I could handle the stress of another bad experience. It took me nearly a month to use it.\n\nThis past week, I returned and took with me the kind coworker who offered me their take home sushi. We made sure to go on a day where we didn't have any appointments immediately after lunch. We also arrived early. Once again, the place was practically empty. There were only 4 other people there. \n\nWe started off with drinks as we pondered the menu. The drinks my friends, are heavenly. I had a lychee mojito and an apple saketini and practically downed them in one gulp. Filled to the brim, tasteful and beautiful works of art they were. \n\nWe both ordered a few different items. I got two rolls and some nigiri. I was honestly shocked at the relatively ok speed at which they came out. We received our sushi about a half hour after ordering it. Still not super fast, but well, it's better than not getting it at all. The presentation was decent and the sushi was delicious. My ebi nigiri came with a tempura shrimp in the shape of a bunny. That creeped me out a lot. Please don't do that.\n\nIn the end, the service is still slow enough and I've had so many bad experiences there, that I would not trust it for lunch. It will never be in my top 5 places to go at any point in time. However, if I end up arriving at Tempe Marketplace 3 hours early for an event, or if someone wants to go to grab a saketini, I will consider it. The only saving grace this establishment has is it's corporate office, a saketini, and decent sushi (once you get it).\n\nThere are rumors that my picture may be in the back of the restaurant as a warning for when I come in.... hopefully this is not the reason I had a slight improvement in service.","useful":6,"funny":3,"cool":3}

The first were some pretty healthy treats that they always seem to devour. The second were these lovely felt pieces to be used as toys on tile and hardwood floors. I also think they were laced with catnip. Holy bat shit batman!! Those little toys spun so fast across the house that Bic and Sharpie didn't know what to do. They were going crazy. It is so awesome to see them get so much delight and challenge out of such a simple toy. This is usually one of the first local stores I head to for new kitten gear. After that, I resort to looking online.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":2}

The angels singing? \n\nIn yet another episode of My Impulsive Life, I was working on rearranging a room and decided to repurpose an old bookshelf as my new storage unit for my bags and hats. When all was finished I decided it needed something more. Fabric as some type of cover and a little bit of class. But I couldn't find anything open nearby and those that were had some really piss poor excuses for fabric collections.\n\nI posted on facebook about my frustration and get a response to try 35th Ave Sew and Vac. I didn't hesitate as I was desperate and in the mood to shop. Having one of the cross streets in the name is a huge help too, let me tell ya. I found the place easily and was excited to get started in my search.\n\nAt first it looked like there was a very limited selection of fabric and I started to weep (on the inside, don't worry). Then a skinny hallway and narrow beacon of light directed me to the mecca of fabric. I was lost in no time, wandering about the rows and admiring the selections. They were categorized beautifully and the taxonomy\/library science geek in me swooned. Everything was so easy to find.\n\nFinally I made a decision and headed to the checkout. They were so nice and friendly and it was a breeze to pay and make my way home to use my newly found goods. Everyone I encountered seemed really knowledgeable and courteous, which is nice, because I actually don't know a damn thing about sewing except that I can't do it.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":2}

I love the atmosphere at the Farm at South Mountain. However, the Morning Glory Cafe left much to be desired. \n\nI didn't mind the wait, as that's typical during weekend brunch. I especially loved that we were lucky enough to get a table on the outside of the layout so that I could keep my bike near me while we ate. Unfortunately, there is no good way to lock your bike up while on the property from what I could see. And this isn't just because I'm overprotective about my bike (though we all know I am).\n\nThe service was fairly good. Our sever kindly answered all our questions and dealt with our crazy bill splitting. Our meals came out in a reasonable amount of time and all at the same time too :)\n\nOn recommendation of the server, my debate between the spinach mushroom omelet and the eggs Benedict ended with the Benedict. I probably would've rather had the omelet or some a la carte items. For some reason the eggs Benedict just seemed overly spiced to me, and I love spice. The home fries didn't look or taste right either, though I've seen pictures of them looking delicious :-\/\n\nAs far as beverages go, the revolution individual herbal teas are the awesome. I didn't even know revolution made those. LOVE. Also loved the way my friend's mimosa came, with a small carafe of orange juice and a tiny bottle of sparkling wine. Individual sized things are also the awesome.\n\nOne other small note... crayons for the tables would be awesome if you always use the white paper as a tablecloth!!\n\nWill I come back again?

My only hope is to have it hit farther in Tempe or Mesa that I can take my bike and ride a few miles in after a stop... but I don't think that will happen either. I know that's not really the LR's fault, but it still makes me bitter.\n\nThe adventures are fun on the LR and it's actually helped this newby that's terribly unblessed with being navigationally challenged on top of it to navigate the Phoenix area, downtown in particular.

It was a few miles from my house and down an old back road, smack dab in the middle of gorgeous scenery. There is a very large indoor area to sit as well as a large outdoor area as well, and a pond and vineyard on site.\n\nIt well beat out the bar scene for several reasons. First off was that you could bring in your own dinner and enjoy a bottle of wine and dinner with friends. For this reason, it ended up being the location for several of my birthday parties. 15 of us or so would grab a table, bring some delicious tapas, someone would bring a cake, and we'd have several bottles of wine and still be able to have a conversation. Being on a back road it was easy to get home and there was never traffic. They had board games available also and snack plates of their own.\n\nTheir wine is incredible. I remember the day I had my first taste of their Red Kiss. At the time it wasn't even being bottled and was only available in house. They bottled it a few months later, at Thanksgiving and I gave it to many friends and family members as presents. The perfect combination of chocolate and red wine (neither of which I like separately) was irresistible. Their ice wine is to die for, and I love their party wine with the crazy gnome on the label. \n\nI also cannot forget the owners which are incredible.

Kinda. Because it took 20 minutes for it to work. But we seem to be okay now. Hopefully I can get through this.\n\nNow that I have that off my chest I have to say I'm confused. Why? Because, according to yelp, the Mazda dealership near 16th St & Camelback brands its service department under a completely different name. But I have never experience that in my contact with them or mailings I receive. It's always been Camelback Mazda. Alas, I am getting service, so I guess this is the company I need to file it under.\n\nAfter being here a few times, I have to say it's pretty much so-so. The first time I was here, I had an amazing experience with the service department. Iain was fantastic and told me what was up and showed me what was going on. I hate when mechanics and service staff just assume I'm gonna throw money at them without understanding the issue. It's crazy. He also gave me a loaner car when it was going to be longer than expected, which I truly appreciate. Granted it was a horrid orange Subaru wagon\/SUV thing that was SO not my Mazda, but it worked.\n\nThis time, I'm a little less optimistic. The time it took me to even get my car into service was a nightmare. I sat there while some typing was going on and questions were asked that should've been in my record and on my appointment (like WTF I'm getting done). Other Mazda dealerships I've been to have had that ready when I got there. I just review sign, and go hop to my coworking. The end. Get with it. It took 15 minutes for my car to even get back there. Maybe I should get here 20 minutes early next time. \n\nHowever, the lobby if you need to wait is fantastic. I always choose to sit and wait because it gives me time to catch up on things, like yelp reviews. There's a TV, some couches, high tables to sit and work at, wifi, popcorn, coffee, soda, and slushies. Oh and this great photo wall of people kayaking. I uploaded it so you don't miss out.\n\nOverall not too bad, but time will tell how consistent the check-in procedure is.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1}

From what I saw on their menu, I was very excited to see what was i store for me and had heard pretty decent things. I walked out not that excited. \n\nThe ambiance inside is very nice, though a bit on the dark side. The decor inside told a completely different story than what I was thinking when I saw the entrance. It is very posh inside and I did like the comfy booths.\n\nWe arrived early enough to get the early bird special, which appeared to be a better deal than the yelp eats one. I wonder if this was truly our best choice. \n\nFor me when it comes to pasta, I am a bit picky. This mainly comes from the fact that I don't like really heavy sauces and I really do not like tomatoes. It has to be a good Italian place and not your run of the mill to get me excited.\n\nMy first course was a Caesar salad. Wait take that back. That was supposed to be my first course. I believe I really got romaine lettuce, croutons and dressing of the day. It definitely was *not* Caesar. This left me sad. The bread with it though was pretty damn good although I suggest bigger bottles of balsamic. We ran out fast! \n\nMy main course was chicken marsala and a side of penne. The penne came with a paste (note I did not say sauce) and seemed a little dry and bland.

I stalked it clear back when it was first announced... and when only digital renderings were available... when I kept wanting to visit but it was a drive...\n\nAnd then it happened. I had the opportunity to go and I was so excited. I examined the exhibits one more time online. And arrived before my date to take in the outside. It's beautiful. The whole building is absolutely beautiful. The outside courtyard. The contours and lines of the inside.\n\nNearly every exhibit has a sample of the music and dance of the region\/country and so they aren't all interfering with each other, they give you headsets to wear during the tour. Usually I pass on these, but this wasn't additional information, it was part of the exhibit. So I walked around, looking like a doofus but geeking out on music.\n\nThe museum has a lot of stuff. A lot. Nearly every country is represented. Countries most don't normally associate with having their own music, such as Afghanistan. It was amazing to see the differences and the similarities in the instruments. The low fidelity versus the highly detailed, each works of art in their own way. My mind wandered and I daydreamed as I explored. One thing I realized is while all countries have something in common typically (same types of instruments), the US is seriously lacking in things that rattle.. bracelets, skirts, headdresses, etc... I call for more rattling in our instruments.\n\nSome other interesting things I found were a hot pink star guitar, that made me want to try to play the guitar again, tiny instruments, and a Victory Piano, which I've never seen up close and in person until this trip. And the piano rooms... and organ rooms... oh sweet heaven. Good thing they had lots of security.. because I was SO TEMPTED to sit and play. I wanted to play all those pianos so badly.  They do have some rooms where you can try and do some hands on stuff.. but it's never the same as the works of art that are for display only.\n\nTowards the end, the museum was closing and I found it hard to take time to see the rest... and I'd already spent 3 hours there...I probably needed another hour or so.\n\nI'm sure this space is going to be great for concerts and I really enjoyed my trip. So why the sad 3 stars? Two main reasons:\n\n1) It's supposed to be a museum, which to me is something you can enjoy time and time again. As of now, it doesn't look like they have any rotating or special exhibits, which will make it hard to justify a return.\n\n2) The navigation is horrible. There are multiple entrances to each region, but only one is the \"right one\" that allows you to navigate in a normal pattern. However, you have no guides with signage or anything on which is the preferred entrance (though I beg to ask why is there more than one if one leads you in an unnatural pattern). They put so much time, money and effort into this museum.. I really wish they had hired some UX folk. If they did, I wish they were better.\n\nIt's worth a visit.. honestly.

When I needed to take a break from looking, no one got upset, no one was offended and no one pushed me. When I was ready, Jenny was there. \n\nFirst thing that I really appreciate was her professionalism. She always came prepared to showings with all the information from the MLS listing and prepared me for anything I may need to know beforehand. When it came to paperwork and the house buying checklist, she was on top of it and made sure that I didn't miss a beat and was ahead of schedule for anything I needed to sign, stamp or seal.\n\nJenny was also prepared and a super trooper for real. Need to walk in a monsoon flooded yard to check the condition of the roof... in heels? No worries. Need to go back and forth around a house to find a lock box that ends up being behind prickly bushes? No worries. Need to find out the skinny on a house that you adore but that has a public hearing sign in front of it and the LISTING agent doesn't know why it's there? No worries. She's totally on top of it.\n\nShe's super nice and funny too. She's totally down to earth and isn't afraid to tell me exactly what I'm in for and what to look out for and point out both positive and negative features of houses and their neighborhoods. \n\nBonus for you mid-century modern lovers because that's exactly what Twins and Co specializes in!\n\nAnd if this isn't enough for you, she is still there for you after the sale. You know.. when your water stops getting hot.. your oven acts up.. and everything in between. She's helped me figure out what's a home warranty issue, what's not and contacted the home inspector to help me out too when an answer was needed.\n\nI am positive they put the same effort into the houses they sell also. \n\nIf you are in the market to buy or in the market to sell, you cannot miss an opportunity to work with this wonderful team.

The first mocha was heaven and we have been inseparable ever since. \n\nOne of my favorite elements of Solo is the atmosphere. It has a feel that is truly all its own. While the furniture and initial look may seem like the typical eclectic coffeehouse, I assure you it is so much more. The cafe has unique and comfortable furniture, games to play, books to read, and free wifi. The lighting is just perfect so that anyone can feel comfortable working yet also take a break and be instantaneously relaxed.\n\nEqually important is their amazing menu and fabulous coffee skills. I can never get enough of the cherry danish and an iced peppermint cream, which is a tea-based beverage. I can also say that they have the best mocha I've had in the Phoenix area to date. \n\nLast but not least is the friendly staff.

The dance floor is small, but the coolness of this place comes from how much history has taken place there.  It's one of the very small number of lounges that is pretty much original from the age of Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin.  Just, don't ask the bar to make you a mojito.  I made that mistake, and they gave me something that tasted like chocolate-mint flavored awfulness.  Other than that, feel free to check out no-cover shows taking place there Tuesday through Saturday nights, starting at 10 pm.

I went here with a friend recently, and the experience was - for the most part - great.  Being a vegetarian, it's always awesome to find an entire portion of a menu devoted to vegan- or vegetarian-friendly items; but Gardein??  Love love love.  I got a Gardein chicken sandwich, and it was delicious.\n\nThe only problem with our order was with my friend's sandwich.  She has a sulfur allergy, and requested one of the toppings be held from her order; though the waiter Did, in fact, input the order correctly, there was a miscommunication somewhere and the offending ingredient wasn't removed.  She realized it as soon as she bit into it, so not much harm done, but if it were a life or death allergy, this would've been serious.  They remade the sandwich for her, and both our waiter and the manager came by to personally apologize for the incorrect (and in this case, hazardous) order.  Though, of course, we would've preferred the order be correct to start with, we're just glad the situation was rectified.  The service we received made up for the error.\n\nI definitely plan on returning to try more of the wondrous vegetarian and vegan options.  If you're on the Strip looking for good options as a healthy eater, this is the place!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I did ask KEVAN about this customization and he did not approve such a thing.  We are a franchise and unfortunately NOT allowed this.  I agree with you!  Mango&Passion is NOT a WACKY drink.  Alas the higher powers that be do not allow this.  In fact NEVER.  Trouble has been issued to us for such WACKY concoctions.  Silly?  I concur.\n\nI do hope you re-consider your review about this matter.  We really can't do it.  Your disdainful rating will have to stay with us.  You can hate us, be long gone with us, and be happy at Starbucks.  We try our best and if we messed up your drink.. Sorry again.  \n\nYou can go to the other Kung Fu Tea... They will get in trouble.  In fact you just got them in trouble.  No stamp cards there either.  I think YOU should question them about it.  Not us.\n\nDominic\n************UPDATE\/RESPONSE*** 9\/20\/2016**********************\nThank you for your reply.\n\nWho are you suggesting I question, and about what?\n\nAs a point of clarification, in the past Kevan made these drinks for us himself. It wasn't necessarily a matter of needing his approval?... regardless, I completely understand now that it was not something he \"should\" have been doing and that you are bounded by rules.... rules that do not reflect amazing customer experiences.\n\nDominic I'd be more than happy to give your store the 5 stars it deserves, but you too are missing the big picture. You FAIL to acknowledge it in your reply as well. You failed to show us how much you CARE about our needs as the customer. You expressed understanding about our frustrations... BUT as the OWNER you offered NO further solutions... as simple as\n\n \"I will continue to submit requests the to the powers that be for this alteration as I understand this change will make many of my customers happy.\" \n\nYOU are the person in the best position to express this need and push for the changes to occur.

Today I had the worst customer experience of my life. I asked the cashier \"When you have a moment could you please come wipe out table down its kind of sticky\" the place was dead and he wasn't occupied but he never came. Ok I thought no worries. Our food was delivered to us by another gentlemen by the name of Daniel. I asked Daniel \"Could you wipe the table down for us when you get a chance\" he replied \"sure\". As he walked away with his back turned to he says \"a please would be appreciated \" in a completely passive aggressive tone. He's right I should have said please but that doesn't change the fact that he was being completely unprofessional. When he came back I proceeded to address the situation as he comment made me feel really uncomfortable. I told him hey I don't appreciate being spoken to In such an aggressive manner. He then proceeded to argue and escalate the situation in a completely immature way. Cherry on top when our argument concluded he followed it up with \"cool story bro\" that really got my blood boiling. I'm not one to complain but I felt the need to get a manager involved at this point. Their employee had disrespected me and was being completely unprofessional. When I spoke to them they mocked and asked me what they should do \"sit him down and give him a stern talking to\" with a huge grin on their face. They essentially blew me off and expect me to believe that will address the situation with the runner? Yea, I don't think so. It wasn't until another runner came out from the kitchen and acknowledged the situation and explained that Daniel can be a bit of a dick. It isn't my fault that's he's a dick or is having a bad day. They shouldn't take it out on their customer and if he can't deal with customers then he shouldn't be working in the customer service industry. I can honestly say that I will not be returning to chicken shack not after the complete disregard they showed for customer satisfaction.","useful":6,"funny":1,"cool":0}

Of course, like most of these hotel restaurants, it prices itself way high and makes you think you're getting a better experience than you really are getting. The service is decent, not great, but decent. \n\nOn my two visits, I ordered the Pad Thai noodles with pot sticker dim sum and Hor Fun with Satay Chicken. Being a Thai food aficionado, there was something a bit odd about the Pad Thai, almost a sickly sweet taste to it. The pot stickers were not exceptionally noteworthy. The Hor Fun was the best dish I ordered. The Satay Chicken was good, but it's pretty hard to screw that dish up.\n\nI applaud them for giving correct portion sizes. They do not dump a truckload of food on a plate. It's a respectable serving size without making you feel like a glutton for finishing your bowl. The service was a bit sketchy. Not awful, but not great. My waitress just had the attitude of \"what do you want to eat,\" not \"can I answer any questions you might have?\" \n\nOverpriced, yes. Underwhelming, no. If you find yourself in a pinch like I did, needing to grab a bite to eat while on a break, Noodles is a good choice. Otherwise, I'd stick to finding other real-deal restaurants in Vegas and steer clear.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1}

That's a shame, because my experience was fantastic.\n\nWe had a 6:45pm reservation (made months in advance) and had to wait 30 minutes when we arrived. The manager personally came out to apologize to us and offered us drinks and dessert on the house for the entire evening. I've been to plenty of places where they sort of shaft you on the amount of alcohol - not here. I ordered a Jack & Coke with a lime wedge to start off with and the bartender, on his own, made it with Gentleman Jack and it was stiff to say the least. Nice crushed ice served in a very unique high ball glass. All night long, they made sure that a fresh high ball glass of our drinks were following as soon as one was empty. \n\nWith what I thought was a proper handling of the table situation, we waited for our table to open, sipping drinks and admiring the scenery. Once seated, we ordered the Port Judith Calimari and the seared yellowfin tuna for starters. Both were outstanding. I'm a harsh judge of calimari and Emeril's did not disappoint. Still not the best I've ever had, but definitely up there. I ordered the pecan crusted Texas redfish, pepper jack potato rosti, creole meuniere sauce and grilled vegetable ratatouille. It was absolutely delicious. The smash across the face you received from the melody of flavors was incredible. I don't recall what my friend ordered but he was raving about it.\n\nFor dessert, we were told by our waitress if there is one dessert you must try, it is Emeril's Banana Cream Pie. Words fail to describe how delicious and filling this was. It was served in a nice warm cast iron skillet, with gorgeous chocolate shavings nestled on top.  \n\nThe service: top notch. Our waitress was prompt, courteous, full of recommendations and explanations of flavors on each dish, and never far from us. Zero complaints. I never once had to ask for anything - it just appeared. \n\nThe interior d√©cor: well thought out, with a nice earth tone color scheme which is accentuated by a wide variety of brilliant sapphire blues, yellows, purples, reds, and silvers at the bar and around the restaurant. It has a very trendy, but authentic New Orleans flare to it. The bar at the center has a nice feel to it, with nicely back lit liquor shelves to showcase Emeril's offerings. There is a ridiculous amount of wine racks all around the exterior of the restaurant, giving patrons quite the selection from which to choose.\n\nThe price: frankly, I thought the prices on the menu were fair for the caliber of restaurant such as Emeril's in a city like Vegas. My entr√©e was $28, and when I got the bill, much to my surprise, the manager had also comped our appetizers. So all we ended up paying for was our entr√©es. Really, that is going above and beyond to correct a mistake.\n\nThe manager paid us a visit once at the end of our meal to ask how everything was, apologizing once again for the delay, and asking us if we would come back. The answer was a resounding yes. We thanked him for his hospitality and his drive to make our visit the best it could be.\n\nI am sure sorry if Emeril's at the MGM Grand has gone downhill since I visited a few years back. But I stand by my review. When I was there, they treated us incredibly well and made a faux pax on their part with our reservation right.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":1}

I really needed to access some documents on my laptop waiting for my flight and was sitting at Appropos in the F gate area. When I asked the waitress why I can't get on the wi-fi, she responded that \"oh yeah this side of the airport doesn't get good wi-fi.\" What? Are you kidding me? You are at a major international airport for crying out loud and you can't provide even a basic wi-fi connection? I'm not asking for speed, I'm merely asking for a connection. The iPads at each area are a very classy touch, and the food\/drinks at the above mentioned restaurant by the gate were top notch. The gates themselves were deficient in seating area, so most passengers lined up to sit on the edge of the people mover.\n\nCustoms coming in to Toronto were amongst the nicest and easiest I've ever had to deal with - even giving service with a smile which is unheard of anywhere else. I guess  the Canadians live up to their pleasant and friendly stereotype, even at customs.

It's a pretty well laid out airport, and making connectors is pretty much a snap because of the super fast people movers that wisp you away to this and that gate area. \n\nI was there not too long ago and had an early morning 1.5 hour layover. Ate at a typical Tex-Mex place that served chorizo and scrambled eggs. Quite tasty and I like how they mix in plenty of restaurants around the gate areas. \n\nIt's a big and busy airport, but navigating it is very straight forward. If I'm heading out West, this is an airport that I don't mind hanging in if I have to have a layover. It features free wi-fi that seemed to work wherever I went. The airport and it's bathrooms are very clean and well maintained. \n\nA word to the wise: if you are running a low battery on your electronic devices, you're better off sitting down at a restaurant and trying to find a wall outlet to mooch power from than you are trying to find an available outlet at the gate area. They are few and far between at the gates and you can almost rest assured someone has beaten you to the punch in using it. So I usually go into a restaurant, scope out an outlet near a table or a booth, sit down and use that. Of course, just to be courteous, I'll order something to eat to make it fair.

I love the blue sky and clouds mural on the ceilings and the light effects they do to mimic day light. The casino floor is nice, but I think Paris thinks a bit too highly of themselves because their table minimums were awfully high, and their poker tourneys were set at buy-ins that were so high that they were only filling half of the field.\n\nHowever, Paris does have one little thing that sets it apart from every other place on the Strip: their breakfast buffet. This breakfast spread they have, set in a Parisian village theme, is absolutely out of control. I have never in my life seen so many different options on a breakfast buffet. At $30\/person, it's steep, but it is an experience you'll never forget. In the \"you're not going to believe this just happened to me\" Vegas-story fashion, my buddy and I are standing in this incredibly long line waiting to pay our $30 each and these two incredibly cute girls walk out of the buffet area and headed over to us. They asked us if we'd like two free coupons for the buffet; of course we took them graciously and chatted for just a minute. They had to go to the airport and weren't going to be in town to use them. They informed us we didn't have to wait in line, we could just walk in -- and walk in we did. Certain things in life are just perpetual game-changers, and Paris' breakfast buffet is one of them.\n\nEverything you ever wanted or could dream of wanting for breakfast was there. Since that experience, it's been a tradition that every time I'm in town, I go to Paris for breakfast only. They can keep the gaming and sell that to the tourists. If I want to game, I'll go to the MGM, Rio, Caesars or the Bellagio. In fact, Paris could just close its casino as far as I'm concerned and keep the breakfast buffet open. This is also where my nickname \"Bullmoose\" originated, so it's been a great story to tell!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The casino is so huge that I still haven't seen all of the 170,000+ square feet of gaming area. MGM sort of bridges the gap between a great casino and a great resort. It ties both in with a proper attention given to both. You can find very reasonable rates per night there. It's conveniently located at the South end of the strip, so coming from McCarron International, your cab fees will be light. When you pull up to the MGM, you can just sense the rich history of this place. The epic pay-per-view boxing matches, the world-renowned shows, the great concerts, etc. When the sign says \"The City of Entertainment,\" you have no problem believing it. The lobby is a beautiful marble with the MGM lion front and center. It is a grand entrance, which is both breathtaking and elegant. \n\nFrom a gaming perspective, I love that the MGM connects both low rollers and high rollers and doesn't discriminate their table offerings based upon a crowd they're trying to attract, such as The Wynn, The Bellagio, or the Venetian. You can easily still find $5 blackjack tables there, and of course, the $100 tables are always available. The mid-range rooms are very nice. The beds are super comfortable, nice blackout curtains in the afternoon to block out that intense summer time sun. The bathrooms are spacious and luxuriously appointed. \n\nOf all the casinos I've visited, the dealers at the MGM have been by far the most cool, down-to-earth, fun, funny and engaged. The casino has many restaurants, including Emeril's, there are day spas, pool and beach area for the kids, and nice shops if that's your thing.\n\nI can't think of a better place if you've never been to Vegas and want the experience without laying down a boatload of cash to get it. I will always rotate MGM into my stays in Vegas. It was my first and will always hold a special place in my heart.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1}

From the moment we walked in, it was clear that this was a masterpiece of Las Vegas. The feel, the atmosphere, everything was first class. The hand blown glass tulips in the lobby are breathtaking. There is an air of classiness to this place that seems lacking in other casinos (not all of them) on the strip. Bellagio feels like it runs at a slower, more deliberate pace. The staff were first class and very professional. \n\nThe room itself made you want to stay and appreciate it. Everything from the fully stocked wet bar, to the view, to the absolutely gorgeous bathroom with steam shower and hot tub, to the most comfortable beds just made the Bellagio steal the show. The view of the strip is awesome. There is so much to do in the hotel\/casino that you could really just stay there; lots of high end shops, restaurants, salon & day spa, etc. can fill your day with activities.\n\nFortunately, I had been to Vegas twice prior to staying here so I could justify just hanging out and taking in as much as I could. Everything about the Bellagio is just dripping with elegance. I know that now, it is considered one of the \"older\" hotels on the strip, but that does not make it any less appealing. At night time, it is always an experience to go take in one of the fountain shows. \n\nYeah, it's pricey, but it's doable if you're visiting off-season and work your magic on the internet to book a room with them. The room service is flawless. \n\nOn the casino floor, they are very aggressive to make sure you have drinks while you are gaming and even if you are not. I came down the elevators early one morning around 5:45am to grab a newspaper and a coffee. A very attractive young waitress approached me as I walked out of and asked me if she could get me a drink. I told her I was just looking for some coffee and a newspaper. She told me she would go get me one and asked me if I would like Bailey's with it, to which I happily accepted. I wandered over and grabbed a newspaper, and she was waiting for me with not one, but two cups of coffee with lids on them.\n\nBellagio will always hold a special place in my heart.

The Sands in its heyday was the height of class, and the Venetian proudly carries that torch.\n\nThey spent a tremendous amount of time, research, architectural detail, and of course money to make this place what it is. I've gamed there many times and what stood out to me was how nice and friendly everyone was, right down to the pit bosses. \n\nThe only thing that keeps me from staying there is that constant incense smell that is overpowering when you walk in.

We rented two rooms and to begin with the carpets were filthy in the room and hallways, one room the sofa a ripped lining which hung on the floor. The alarm clock made this really weird humming noise and I had to unplug the makeup mirror was broken and had no light as well as the base was broken so it listed to one side. When you flushed the toilet the outside sink gurgled for a few minutes. I asked for two non-smoking rooms and one stunk of cigarette smoke.\n\nI stayed at the Rio for three days and one of my rooms was not cleaned for two consecutive days. When I called housekeeping they tried to say that we were in the room too long in the morning but we were up and out by 11AM each day. The Rio has two pools one with a waterfall and another that is heated were kid mainly enough themselves. This pool was absolutely disgusting. The white tile had a filthy black ring around it. Once I returned home I completed a survey sent to me by the Rio and I heard nothing but once I posted a review such as this one on Trip Advisor I was contacted by the Total Rewards depart offering me an upgraded room the next time I visited. \n\nThis tells me that they in fact had cleaner and better maintained rooms if you pay extra, otherwise you get filth, no housekeeping services and tattered furniture. I would have to be out of my mind to throw good money behind bad. Keep in mind that the Rio \"All Suites\" Hotel and Casino is owned by Caesars Entertain who also own Caesars Palace, Paris, Bally the Quad and a number of other \"Strip\" properties. It's clear to me that the Rio is there \"Ghetto\" property where they clip poor unsuspecting tourists who are trying to save a few dollars while on vacation. \n\nSince my return I have done extensive research on this property and the vast majority of the negative reviews are consistent with the property being a poorly maintained dump. Don't believe the glitz and glamour that you see on the Discovery Channel this place truly sucks and management knows about it. \n\nBUYERS BEWARE!!!!","useful":8,"funny":0,"cool":1}
